I landed a job at the only PR firm that called to interview me because I knew someone who worked there.

Years later when I was freelancing, my network helped me pay the rent. When I moved to a new city, networking helped me meet new friends. Today, networking and relationship building is more important for me than ever, whether I'm trying to find new client leads or place stories in the media for my clients. 

It's been one of my goals to get out there and meet new people all while maintaining my existing network. Many of you can relate to the fact that isn't easy. Despite my bubbly, quirky exterior, I'm an introvert. That statement might surprise many who know me, but I have disciplined myself over the years to get over it. Networking takes time, energy and focus, but it pays off. Here are the tips and tricks I've learned to make the process easier and more effective.

1.       Be genuine: Sometimes you can be so overwhelmed or focused on an end goal (i.e, meet two qualified client leads) that you come across as awkward. I find that simply being myself helps mitigate potential awkwardness. Plus, when you're meeting new people, they want to get a sense of who you really are. Let your light shine!

2.       Focus on image: I like to put on a power suit or dress that makes me feel my most confident. When you look good, you'll feel and appear more confident. Plus, image really does matter. If your pants are wrinkled and your shirt is stained, people will focus on that instead of your killer business idea or great conversational skills.

3.       Ask questions: People LOVE to talk about themselves. I've found that the easiest way to make someone like you is to ask great questions and be genuinely interested in them. Plus, by asking questions, you'll be guiding the conversation as opposed to talking at your new contact.

4.       Make eye contact and SMILE: This might seem like common sense, but I can't tell you how many times I've met people who don't do these two simple things. If your eyes are darting around the room, it tells me that you're looking for someone more important. If you forget to smile, it says you'd rather be anywhere else. Focus on being present.

5.       Don't be afraid to go alone: Networking events are intimidating, so people often bring someone else to lean on as a crutch. But having a crutch might prevent you from opening up to new people. I like to go to networking events alone because I never know who I'll talk to. It makes the possibilities endless.

6.       Always carry business cards: Your kid's softball game or a friend's BBQ could unexpectedly turn into a networking opportunity. You never know who you'll meet.

7.       Be a connector: Do a favor before you ask for one. Connect people who you think will benefit from knowing each other. Share knowledge without expecting anything in return. If you can bring something to the table for a new or existing connection, they'll likely return the favor.

8.       Know when to gracefully exit the conversation: We've all been there before - you're stuck in a long conversation with someone who isn't likely to provide value in your network (and vice versa). I like to find a natural pause in the conversation, and then say, ""It has been such a pleasure chatting with you. I am going to mingle with more folks around the room, but here's my card and do keep in touch."" It's an honest, straightforward approach that doesn't make you seem rude.

9.       Ask for new contacts: From time to time, I'll ask people in my network if they know of other people with similar interests who I should meet. Meeting new contacts through mutual connections is much easier than finding them on your own.

10.   Follow up: Don't let those business cards just sit on your desk. I connect with each new person I meet on LinkedIn and send a personalized, thoughtful email within 24 hours. I like to find a relevant article to share, include some anecdote from our conversation and comment on an aspect of their business. I've found most people to be responsive with this approach. Once the new connection responds, I ask them to meet one-on-one for coffee, lunch or drinks. And every once in awhile, I'll comb through my network to follow up with people. Sometimes that means we schedule an in-person get together, sometimes it's a phone call to catch up, but most of the time it's an email or Facebook post. And that's OK. Just stay in touch however you can.

11.   Network online AND offline: Use LinkedIn and Twitter to meet new people. Is there someone on Twitter in your industry that you admire? Let them know and ask them to coffee. I've met many friends and valuable business connections through social media.

12.   Create your own events: If you don't like going to networking events or want something new to augment the events you're already going to, create your own! In 2012, I realized that I knew a lot of powerful women in my industry. I decided to start a monthly dinner club and encouraged these women to invite others into the circle. While it lasted, it was a great success. I usually hosted between 20 - 30 women each month. It was a great way to connect people and meet new contacts myself.

Hillary Clinton herself is apparently to blame for this one, as this was the playful name she came up with for the van she used to get from New York to Iowa this week.  The media, as it will be doing for the next year and a half over pretty much any new aspect of Hillary Clinton's campaign (and we do mean ""any new aspect at all -- even the laughably trivial""), quite predictably, freaked out.
Looking at the ""Scooby van"" through the lens of talking points (as we are wont to do, here), we have to say that one thing struck us about Hillary's choice: her inattention to the proper geeky level of detail.  Ask any Scooby Doo fan, and they'll tell you the van in question was actually called ""The Mystery Machine.""  Hillary is showing the same level of cultural tone-deafness as when she flubbed her big opening line, saying: ""Live from New York, it is Saturday Night!""  She may not have been the only guest host in the entire history of the show who failed to properly say ""it's"" instead of ""it is,"" but she sure was the first one we ever noticed, cringing all the while.  Hillary's getting plenty of other grief this week, over all sorts of microscopic things (our favorite: Jimmy Kimmel's alternate logos for Hillary), so we'll quickly move on from that sort of thing.  We wouldn't want to get trampled by the rest of the media, chasing after the Scooby van, to put it another way.
We do have to say we feel a little bit sorry for other Democrats out there contemplating a run for the White House.  How can any hopeful compete with the blanket coverage all things Clinton will be receiving for the foreseeable future, after all?  Lincoln Chafee tried to make news this week with his own contemplation of a presidential bid, but got no traction.  Martin O'Malley tried to paint a contrast, but nobody paid much attention.  Bernie Sanders is waiting in the wings for the progressive movement to finally realize that Elizabeth Warren is just not going to run this time and by doing so realize that he's actually their best bet to get their message heard, but this has yet to happen according to Salon.  The Clinton shadow is long and all-encompassing, eclipsing all others already, it seems.
At least on the left.  Over in Republicanland, more and more candidates will be officially jumping in the race in the coming weeks.  Harry Reid perhaps summed up the way most Democrats feel about the Republican field, stating bluntly: ""I think they're all losers.""  Now that Reid's announced he'll be stepping down next year, he really has nothing to lose by speaking his mind, so perhaps he'll be the go-to guy for a quote throughout the campaign, who knows?
Time magazine announced their top 100 influential people, and (much to our surprise, since we haven't read Time in decades...) the blurbs about the winners are written by other famous people.  OK, whatever sells magazines, we suppose.  But it did draw a contrast in the presidential race, as Hillary Clinton was the author of none other than Elizabeth Warren's write-up, while Rand Paul authored the paean to the Koch brothers.  Wow -- now that just speaks volumes, doesn't it?  Hillary is obviously courting Democratic base voters (those who would agree with the statement ""I come from the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party,"" in other words), while Rand Paul is shamelessly begging for campaign donations from the ultra-wealthy.  That pretty much speaks for itself -- nothing more need be said, really.
Congress spent the week actually -- are you sitting down? -- getting some things done.  No, really!  Rather than screaming across the aisle, several big deals were struck this week.  As with any deal, there was good news and bad news for both sides.  The week began with an agreed compromise between the Senate and the White House over giving Congress one shot at derailing whatever Iran deal John Kerry comes up with.  They'll have to have a veto-proof majority to do so, the vote will happen within the month after the deal is reached, and they only get one bite at this particular apple -- once the month is over, they can't keep coming back to it (see, for contrast: House, Obamacare votes).  President Obama didn't want any Congressional vote, but then again he got a fairly good deal because Republicans won't be allowed to attach all sorts of poison-pill amendments designed to kill any deal before it is struck.  So both sides got something out of the compromise.
Congress did perform one bit of breathtaking budgetary responsibility this week, but it wasn't sexy enough for the media to notice.  The ""doc fix"" was permanently fixed.  See?  Not sexy at all, and has to be explained to most people.  But it is significant for two reasons.  The first is its honesty.  The ""doc fix""  was nothing more than Congress cooking the books, each and every year.  A bad law was passed over a decade ago, to try to rein in Medicare payments.  On the books, it saved billions in the budget projections (which go out ten years).  But the doctors hated it.  So each and every year, the law was ""postponed"" for another year -- but just a single year, so that the other nine years would magically lower the deficit.  These nine years of savings were complete fiction, but they sure helped all the other numbers in the budget look a little better.  What happened this week was Congress decided to do away with the fiction and overhaul the original bad law.  What this will mean is that we won't have to play fantasyland games each year over a ""doc fix,"" and the budget will reflect a full ten years of reality.  The second reason this is significant is that Republicans just voted to raise the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade without offsetting it elsewhere.  So maybe they'll be a little more open to reality in all their budget negotiations this year?  Well, probably not, but it's something to hope for, in any case.
The other likely deal struck in Congress this week was to move forward on giving President Obama ""fast-track"" authority for the Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade deal he's negotiating.  This is an odd one because it puts Republicans on the side of giving Obama more power (a rarity, you'll have to admit), much to the consternation of the Unions and much of the Democratic base.  Of course, there'll still be a vote in Congress over the deal, but now this will happen without the ability of Congress to amend the deal in any way.
Lest you think that Congress has renounced partisan stupidity, however, the House spent the week passing the ""Paris Hilton Needs More Money Tax Repeal Act"" (or, as the Republicans call it, the ""Death Tax Repeal Act"").  This would eliminate a tax on the 0.2 wealthiest Americans, which the Washington Post appropriately pointed out is not exactly in tune with all the happy talk from Republican presidential candidates over their worries about income inequality.  Good luck squaring that circle, guys!
In odd news (or ""odder news,"" perhaps), a gyrocopter piloted by a disgruntled postal worker landed on the Capitol lawn.  Boy, the dark-humor jokes just write themselves on that one, don't they?  At least, for anyone who remembers the era when ""going postal"" entered the American vocabulary.  Let's see, what else?  Out in California, a lawsuit has been filed in federal court to legalize prostitution on constitutional grounds, so that'll be one to keep an eye on.
Since 4/20 is right around the corner, we'll end with a quick look at the intersection of marijuana and politics.  For anyone who thinks marijuana reformers are overblown in their fears of the consequences of the War On Weed, here's a contrast in how different states are treating the matter legally.  In Kansas, an 11-year-old stood up for medical marijuana in school.  For bravely questioning authority, he was rewarded with a trip to the police station, where they interviewed him for hours (with neither parent present), and then went and raided his mom's home (who suffers from Crohn's Disease) and then for good measure, threatened to award custody of the kid to the child protective services agency.  Right next door, in Colorado, the police have taken a page from the Seattle police and will be handing out snack bags at the big 420 festival, with public-service messages on the packages warning to ""munch, not drive"" after getting high.  They'll also have ""free arcade games at dispensaries loaded with messages not to drive after smoking.""  This tactic was, as we mentioned, first used by Seattle police in 2013 (which we noted here, in FTP [269]).
And Vermont legislators are getting in the spirit of 420 as well.  In an effort to unfreeze bills to legalize recreational marijuana (which are stuck, procedurally), frustrated pro-marijuana legislators have now introduced a bill to bring back Prohibition, instead.  Won't allow a marijuana legalization vote?  Well then, how about we make alcohol illegal again, too?  This shows, we feel, what might be called ""the proper amount of snarkiness.""
OK, that's it for this week's roundup, so let's just move right along.
 

A quick Honorable Mention is in order here first, for the California Democrats who are pushing a bill in the state legislature to force ""crisis pregnancy centers"" to stop lying to women, start giving them medically-accurate information, and start referring women to all their legal options -- or forfeit the taxpayer money they receive.  Sounds like a great idea, one long overdue.
But the big winner of our Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week goes to an organization this week.  The Democracy Alliance is an activist group on the liberal side of things, and they've got a new plan which deserves mentioning and honoring.  They're aiming to get donors to put money collectively into an effort to get Democrats elected at the state level.  Their real target is to improve things by 2020, since that will be when the House of Representatives redistricts again.
Republicans have a clear advantage at the state level, and it got much worse in the 2014 election cycle.  Democrats have to begin to pay more attention to these things, because they have big consequences even at the national level.  Take just one state, Pennsylvania, as an example.  The Keystone State voted twice for President Obama in the last two elections.  Obama got 54 percent of Pennsylvania votes in 2008 and 52 percent in 2012.  Pennsylvania has 18 House seats.  Of them, 13 are held by Republicans -- a whopping 72 percent of the seats.  That is the difference House reapportionment (to say nothing of gerrymandering) means, and that is why state-level elections matter.  Democrats may never retake control of the House of Representatives until they get some fairer districts to compete in.
That starts with getting Democrats elected at the state level.  And Democrats have been heavily outspent and out-organized at this level for a long, long time.  For seeing this lack, and for doing something to address it instead of just hand-wringing, the Democracy Alliance is our Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week.
This effort comes at a good time, since there may be millions of Democrats out there who don't feel the need to financially support Hillary Clinton's campaign.  Either for ideological or personal reasons, or just because people may feel their small donation won't really matter when Hillary's talking about raising 2.5 billion dollars, this could be an alternative way of supporting Democrats this time around.  For providing that option and for targeting it where it seems most needed, the Democracy Alliance is easily the best pick for MIDOTW this week.

We've got seven (Dis-)Honorable Mention awards to hand out, to the Democrats in the House who voted with the Republicans to give the Paris Hiltons of the world more money.  Seriously?  You voted for this?  Here is the roster of shame: Brad Ashford (NE-02), Sanford Bishop (GA-02), Jim Costa (CA-16), Henry Cuellar (TX-28), Collin Peterson (MN-07), Dutch Ruppersberger (MD-02), and Kyrsten Sinema (AZ-09).  (Dis-)Honorable Mention awards, all around.
Our Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week award is for silliness, really.  We realize others might be more deserving and there are more serious subjects than this, but every so often something comes along that is truly jaw-dropping, and this seems to qualify.
Minnesota Democrats (who are called ""Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party"" members, up there) just approved maintaining the decorum in their state's upper legislative chamber by continuing the rule which bans any speaker from making eye contact with any others, while debating on the state senate's floor.  No, seriously, you just can't make this stuff up, folks.  Senate members in Minnesota will continue to be forced to only make eye contact with the presiding officer of the senate, rather than each other.
This is ripe for ridicule, of course, as it should be.  The funniest reaction came from fellow D.F.L. Party member Mike Freiberg of Minnesota's house, who tweeted:
Other Senate rules: use secret handshake, speak in iambic pentameter, drag Stone of Shame if you violate a rule
Heh.  Couldn't have put it better ourselves.  So while there might be other things going on in the political universe, the sheer pomposity and inflated sense of decorum shown by the D.F.L. members of the Minnesota senate, we feel, deserve this week's Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week award.
[Contact Minnesota Senate Majority Leader Thomas Bakk (who spoke out in support of the rule) on his official contact page, to let him know what you think of his chamber's rules.]
 

Volume 342 (4/17/15)
Yet again a mixed bag this week.  Since everybody is already exhausted with all the presidential race coverage, we're going to mostly shy away from that sort of thing for now.  We've got plenty of time... marathon not a sprint... blah, blah, blah.
In the middle of these talking points, there are three taken from a recent survey by Bloomberg.  Salon had the story, or you can take a look for yourself at the survey questions and results [PDF download].  It's a pretty stunning survey, and a pretty good counterargument to the tired old ""America's a center-right country"" nonsense as well.  Talking points three, four, and five are all taken directly from this survey.
OK, that's enough intro.  Let's get on with this week's talking points, shall we?
 
   Congress can't handle war power
For all the blathering over foreign policy coming from Republicans these days (the Senate in particular), there's an uncomfortable truth lurking in the background.  Point it out.
""Republicans keep making noise about how the Senate and the Congress need to be involved in major foreign policy decisions, but when they get the opportunity, they show over and over again that they can't handle the responsibility.  Remember when Republicans were weeping and wailing that Obama's fight against the Islamic State needed congressional approval?  That was almost a year ago.  President Obama did send a proposed draft for a bill to Congress, and the House is incapable of voting on it.  Don't believe me?  Here is John Boehner, when asked this week if Republicans would propose their own bills to define Obama's war powers, if they didn't like the president's proposal -- and I quote: As much as I think Congress ought to speak on this issue, it's going to be virtually impossible to do that.  Unquote.  Why do you think President Obama wants to be able to conduct foreign policy on his own?  Because Congress is completely incapable of doing so.  We're in a military fight that is approaching its first anniversary, and House Republicans say it is 'virtually impossible' that they can draft their own war powers bill.  No wonder Obama didn't wait for them to act.""
 
   More Obamacare good news
Once again, if Democrats don't point out the good stats which continue to roll in, people just don't hear about them.
""Yet another quarter's data shows, once again, that Obamacare is doing precisely what it was intended to do: reduce the number of Americans without health insurance.  This is the measure of success of the program, and the numbers keep getting better and better.  Right before Obamacare took effect, a full 18 percent of Americans didn't have health insurance.  That number has plummeted, and has now reached 11.9 percent.  That is a drop of over one-third in the first two years of implementation.  As time goes by, that number will continue to fall, precisely what the law was designed to achieve.  Obamacare is working, and has already gotten one-third of uninsured Americans health insurance they can afford.""
 
   Other good poll numbers (part 1)
These next three are from the Bloomberg poll cited in the intro.
""Obamacare is actually polling a lot better these days, too, as more people see the reality instead of all the scare stories they were fed by Republicans.  In a recent Bloomberg poll, 51 percent agreed that: ""It may need small modifications, but we should see how it works,"" and a further 12 percent said: ""It should be left alone.""  Only 35 percent said: ""It should be repealed.""  That means 63 percent of Americans think Obamacare should go forward, and should be tweaked when necessary to make it better.  Public opinion on Obamacare keeps going up as time goes by.""
 
   Other good poll numbers (part 2)
This one should be quoted whenever the Republican presidential campaign is being talked about, because the corner they're painting themselves in just keeps getting smaller and smaller.
""Nearly three-quarters of Americans now believe that sexual orientation should receive the same legal protection from discrimination as race in federal law.  That's 74 percent who think the states are going too slow -- or even backward -- on the issue of guaranteeing full rights and protections to gays and lesbians when it comes to employment, housing, and all other aspects of life.  Gay rights are civil rights, according to three in four Americans.  The Republican position on gay rights is looking more and more out of date as time goes by, and I personally wonder when the party is going to realize how much their backward-looking stance is hurting them with voters -- young voters in particular.""
 
   Other good poll numbers (part 3)
OK, this one is just rubbing it in, I fully admit.
""Bloomberg just released a recent poll which was kind of stunning.  They listed a number of Republican politicians, and a number of Democratic politicians, and asked whether people had a favorable or unfavorable view of them.  Every single Democrat (except Harry Reid, who is retiring next year) was a net positive, with better favorable numbers than unfavorable.  Every single Republican (except Rand Paul) was underwater or tied in the favorable/unfavorable rankings.  And even Rand Paul was only a single point on the positive side.  That's a pretty stunning indictment of the way Republicans have been attempting to govern, especially for those on the list who are running for president.  The Republican Party, it seems, has a long way to go to convince people to vote for them next time around.""
 
   Chris Christie will renew War On Weed with a vengeance
Chris Christie is much like the other Democratic presidential candidates, in that he is to be pitied for fading so far into the background.  Still, he said one thing this week that was worth noting, because he staked out a position all other presidential candidates should be forced to comment upon (which I wrote about Wednesday, in fact).
""I think every candidate for president -- Republican and Democratic alike -- should be asked about Chris Christie's recent call for a gigantic federal crackdown on the states which have legalized any form of marijuana.  Christie is stampeding into the past with his call for the feds to start busting everyone in sight in places like Colorado and the other three states which now have legal recreational weed.  Is this really what the voters want from their next president?  Nancy Reagan's 'War On Weed,' on steroids?  I call on everyone now asking for my vote -- from Hillary Clinton to all the Republicans -- to address the issue clearly.  What would you do, if elected, about the states which are charting their own path on marijuana laws?  No dissembling, please -- just a straightforward answer.  Do you support what President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have already done?  Would you do anything differently, and if so, what?  Remember: millions of votes might just hinge on your response.""
 
   Because the D.E.A. is, obviously, so trustworthy...
There was a noteworthy hearing on Capitol Hill this week.
""The head of the Drug Enforcement Agency testified this week in front of a House committee, where she was hauled on the carpet for the agency she controls.  This involved what appeared to be dozens of 'sex parties' with drug cartel members, dating back to 2001.  Fancy weapons were given as gifts to D.E.A. agents from the cartels, and strippers and prostitutes were provided.  Some of these, it appears, were paid for with taxpayer dollars -- what was referred to as 'operational funds' for the D.E.A.  I think most Americans would be disgusted at this sort of behavior -- agents spending their tax dollars on hookers in other countries.  But what happened to the agents responsible?  They were given a slap on the wrist, and then later promoted.  None of them were fired.  The worst punishment handed down was a 10-day suspension.  I've said it before, Michele Leonhart has to go.  She should either step down from her leadership of the D.E.A., or President Obama should just go ahead and fire her.  Either way, she's obviously incapable of leadership.""

Dr. Kristen Lindsey bragged online that she killed a ""feral"" cat in her neighborhood in Brenham. She posted a photo on Wednesday, which shows her holding up the dead cat by an arrow protruding from its head, according to KBTX.

The caption reads:

""My first bow kill, lol. The only good feral tomcat is one with an arrow through it's head! Vet of the year award ... Gladly accepted.""

Warning: The graphic photo Lindsey posted is below.



Lindsey apparently didn't know that the ""feral tomcat"" she bagged was actually Tiger, a 6-year-old orange Tabby who went missing earlier on Wednesday. A Facebook page titled ""Justice For Tiger"" was quickly set up and called for Lindsey to be charged with a crime. The page has photos of Tiger as well as a video that the kitty's owner posted to YouTube in November:



Lindsey also wasn't aware that she'd be fired on Friday. After the post went viral, she reportedly posted to Facebook, ""No I did not lose my job. Lol. Psshh. Like someone would get rid of me. I’m awesome!""

Though she was eventually canned, it wasn't immediately clear whether she'd face criminal charges. Austin County Sheriff Jack Brandes told KBTX that he'd forward the case to the district attorney for review.

Tiger's supporters have been lambasting the scorned vet since the news broke. That said, Lindsey does have supporters of her own. Some of her clients visited her clinic to leave flowers, saying she was good at her job.

The Texas Veterinary Medical Associated issued a press release condemning the post:

We are saddened and disturbed by the unfortunate actions of this individual, and we remind Texas residents that this conduct is not reflective of the veterinary profession or of the veterinarians who strive to embody the words of the veterinarian’s oath every day.

Upon learning of the troubling misconduct, the Brenham clinic where the veterinarian was practicing immediately condemned her actions and terminated her employment. 

Lindsey later removed the post and took down her Facebook page.

All Together is hosted by Paul Raushenbush, Executive Editor of HuffPost Religion. and the host of All Together.   You can download All Together on iTunes, or Stitcher.  

In September of 2012, the Rev. Emily Heath wrote a blog for The Huffington Post called: How To Determine If Your Religious Liberty Is Being Threatened in Just 10 Quick Questions.   

It was just before the Presidential elections and the topic of religious liberty was very hot.  She wrote: ""I'm a religious person with a lifelong passion for civil rights, so this is of great interest to me. So much so, that I believe we all need to determine whether our religious liberties are indeed at risk.""

The questions offered a pointed distinction with  the ""A"" response representing a true religious liberty issue and ""B"" being an example of religious liberty used against another individual or group. 

For example:

1. My religious liberty is at risk because:
A) I am not allowed to go to a religious service of my own choosing.
B) Others are allowed to go to religious services of their own choosing.

2. My religious liberty is at risk because:
A) I am not allowed to marry the person I love legally, even though my religious community blesses my marriage.
B) Some states refuse to enforce my own particular religious beliefs on marriage on those two guys in line down at the courthouse.

And the list goes on.  The battle around the American protection of religious liberty continues with recent bills proposed in Indiana and Arkansas, which purported to protect religious liberty, but were clearly targeting the LGBT community.  The bills and the public outcry around them have revealed a deep division within religious communities and America at large about the meaning of religious liberty and how it can be protected while respecting the civil rights of other citizens. 

On this week's All Together, Raushenbush speaks with Jay Michaelson, the author of five books including ""Gay vs God"", ""Evolving Dharma"" and ""Redefining Religious Liberty: The Covert Campaign against Civil Rights""; Michaelangelo Signoreli, host of The Michaelangelo Signoreli Show on SiriusXM, and the author of ""It’s Not Over’ Getting Beyond Tolerance, Defeating Homophobia and Winning True Equality""; and Jonathan Merritt who is a columnist with Religion News Service, contributing editor at The Week and The Atlantic and the author of Jesus is Better than You Imagined.

40e87a48c46aad3828bafa1cefd6b89e,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/17/gas-line-explosion-fresno_n_7090678.html,"Gas-Line Blast Closes Major Highway, Injures At Least 15","FRESNO, Calif. (AP) — A large gas pipeline exploded into a tower of fire Friday in Central California, closing both directions of a major highway in the region and injuring at least 15 people, four of them critically, authorities said.

It was not clear what caused the explosion at the Fresno County Sheriff's gun range that brought traffic in the area to a halt. But authorities say a work crew that included jail inmates was working with heavy equipment at the time. Four patients were being treated at Community Regional Medical Center's burn and trauma unit, spokeswoman Mary Lisa Russell said. Three of them are in critical condition and one is in serious condition, she said.

Four other patients were taken to St. Agnes Hospital and three more to Madera Community Hospital, and four others were treated and released at the scene, Fresno County Medical Services director Dan Lynch said.

Traffic heading north and south on Highway 99 in Fresno was halted by the explosion about 2:30 p.m. as flames towered over the roadway, the California Highway Patrol reported. The highway was reopened three hours later, the CHP said.

The explosion happened at the Fresno County Sheriff's gun range, where a work crew, including county jail inmates, using heavy equipment apparently hit a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. pipe carrying natural gas, said Tony Botti, a spokesman for the Fresno County Sheriff's Office.

No law enforcement officers were injured, Botti said. A nearby rail line was also halted out of concern that a passing train could spark leaking gas.

Sheriff Margaret Mims said country workers and inmate crews typically work at the shooting range building berms and doing basic maintenance. Four inmate workers are among the injured, she said.

Witnesses reported seeing a large fireball, said Pete Martinez of the Fresno Fire Department. The flames prompted a two-alarm call of firefighters.

The 12-inch diameter pipeline involved in the fire belongs to PG&E, Martinez confirmed. A front loader was in the area, but it's unclear if the vehicle was digging at the time of the explosion. The operator was flown by helicopter to a hospital in serious condition, Martinez said.

""It was a large explosion that shook the surrounding area,"" he said.

The operator of the front loader worked for the construction company, not PG&E, Martinez said.

PG&E spokesman Keith Stephens referred questions to local authorities. Stephens said he could not comment on whether the pipeline involved was PG&E's or whether anyone with PG&E had been at the scene.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with those who are reported to be injured. We do not have definitive information"" on the situation, he said.

PG&E's natural-gas operations have been under intensifying scrutiny in the wake of a fiery 2010 PG&E pipeline blast that killed eight people in the San Francisco suburb of San Bruno.

National Transportation Safety Board investigators blamed faulty safety practices by PG&E, and lax oversight by state regulators, for the 2010 blast.

Earlier this month, state regulators leveled the state's biggest-ever penalty against a utility — $1.6 billion — against PG&E for the San Bruno blast. California Public Utilities Commission President Michael Picker said at the time that continuing safety citations against the utility made him doubt that the utility had embraced a culture of safety, and he raised the possibility of breaking apart the utility's gas and electric operations.-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

Photos released by the Vatican newspaper Thursday showed the German pope toasting a group of Bavarians in the Vatican gardens accompanied by his older brother, Monsignor Georg Ratzinger, and his longtime private secretary.

Pope Francis celebrated Mass in Benedict's honor Thursday morning, saying he hopes God ""supports him and gives him much joy and happiness.""

In recent interviews on the eve of the birthday, Benedict's secretary, Monsignor Georg Gaenswein, said the retired pope feels his age and thinks about his own mortality.

""The emeritus pope thinks about death and is preparing for his death,"" Gaenswein said in an interview with Mediaset television this week. ""It's a Christian art, because preparing for one's death means preparing to meet God.""

Ratzinger became the first pope in 600 years to step down, saying he didn't have the strength of body or spirit to carry on. Gaenswein told La Repubblica newspaper Thursday that he tried to persuade him to stay, but that the Benedict was firm and serene in his decision.

These days, Benedict spends his time reading and keeping up with his correspondences, receiving guests and occasionally playing the piano. He isn't writing any new books, however.

""He told me 'Jesus of Nazareth' is my last book,'"" Gaenswein said, referring to Benedict's three-volume work on Christ's life, released in the final years of his pontificate. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

New York-based writer/performer Aizzah Fatima produced a one-woman comedy show called ""Dirty Paki Lingerie"" as a result of her growing frustration with the limited perception other have of her as a refugee or a victim.

On the other hand, Fawzia Mirza, a Chicago-based actor/writer/producer, explained that a lot of limitations imposed on Pakistani children regarding an artistic career stems from being born in a conservative culture where an artistic endeavor is seen as not financially stable enough and potentially harmful to one's reputation.

The consensus in their artistic endeavor seems to be that their experience is not necessarily representative of the Pakistani experience in general, but that there is a need for a broader representation that would pull away from the usual one and give more insight. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

Blair Kamin's criticism of the ""TRUMP"" sign in Chicago sparked a nationwide debate about private influence on public space. (Photo by Nathan Weber, The New York Times.)

In December, Architect magazine columnist Aaron Betsky listed his ""best and worst"" events from 2014. Among the ""reasons to despair,"" he announced, was ""The New York Times' abandonment of serious criticism of architecture."" As evidence, he pointed to all of Michael Kimmelman's work as the paper's current ""architecture critic"" (Betsky's quotation marks) and a single opinion piece penned by others earlier that month. The first newspaper to appoint a full-time critic--Ada Louise Huxtable, who held the post from 1963 to 1982 and was the first-ever recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism--the Times, according to Betsky, has quit the field it virtually invented fifty years ago. 

The Gray Lady's supposed desertion raises a big question: What is ""serious criticism"" in architecture? This is a vital topic, since architecture critics often shape public opinion as much as architects themselves do, if not more so. I asked a range of respected writers what they think the defining traits of good criticism are. Blair Kamin, the Pulitzer-winning critic of the Chicago Tribune, gave me a list he called ""The Seven Lamps of Architecture Criticism,"" in homage to John Ruskin's 1849 treatise. Shamelessly, I'm stealing and adapting his outline around comments from others.

1.  PRINCIPLED

""We need enlightened critics, not armchair snipers,"" insists Susan Szenasy, Editor-in-Chief of Metropolis. ""The ideal critic is fair, ethical, empathetic,"" says Cathy Lang Ho, the original Editor-in-Chief of The Architect's Newspaper. ""Have a larger point,"" says Alexandra Lange, author of Writing About Architecture: ""Emphasize why [your opinion] matters--in the city, to the public, to the users."" Cathleen McGuigan, Editor-in-Chief of Architectural Record, agrees: ""Judge a project on its own merits. You can't judge a cabin as you would a castle."" Fairness, she points out, means ""not hiding your own strong biases,"" a quality the San Francisco Chronicle's John King refers to as ""honesty."" Michael Sorkin, the former critic for Village Voice, says that good criticism ""defends equity, beauty, and sustainability"" and ""advances kindness, generosity, and excellence."" 

2.  PLAUSIBLE

""Emotion doesn't trump reason,"" says Robert Ivy, formerly of Architectural Record and currently the CEO of the American Institute of Architects. ""Passion will drive a lot, but it's not all there is."" McGuigan uses the term authority, which requires that ""critics become deeply well-informed on every aspect of their subjects' construction, program, context, and limits."" As Kamin puts it, ""Good critics really know their territory. Many media sites now just assemble images and news items without lending a point of view. That's not criticism--it's pimpery.""

3.  PLACED

""Buildings are not merely aesthetic objects,"" says Karrie Jacobs, the original Editor-in-Chief of Dwell magazine. ""Good criticism is not about riffing on a rendering. It considers architecture in the context of the many competing (and often conflicting) forces that shape a building."" Lange agrees: ""Context is one of the ways criticism adds value."" As King puts it, ""Good criticism must be rooted."" Szenasy spells it out: ""Good architecture criticism understands context, be it social, economic, environmental, or cultural. Design without these connections is a hollow exercise in styling."" 

4.  PERSUASIVE

""The critic has to build a persuasive case--brick by brick,"" declares McGuigan. As Sorkin puts it, the best criticism ""fights for its own relevance and remit."" It isn't clouded by ""on the one hand, on the other hand,"" explains Kamin: ""You know what the critic thinks."" Lange adds that ""the most persuasive technique is to get the reader to see things through the critic's eyes. Be visual. Describe the experience so that people can imagine themselves there.""


Top, left to right: Paul Goldberger, Cathy Lang Ho, Robert Ivy, Karrie Jacobs, Blair Kamin. Bottom, left to right: John King, Alexandra Lange, Cathleen McGuigan, Michael Sorkin, Susan Szenasy. 

5.  PASSIONATE

""Criticism depends on love,"" proclaims Pulitzer-winner Paul Goldberger, who adds ""knowledge, judgment, and an ability to balance these things"" as essential qualities. The word ""love"" might surprise you, since, as Lange puts it, many people mistakenly believe that ""criticism equals hating on things."" But Goldberger explains himself in Building Up and Tearing Down: ""A critic who does not love his field cannot last long in it.... To love the thing ... and also to love what it means in other people's lives"" is a prerequisite. Ivy concurs, saying that good criticism reflects ""deep commitment"" and ""love of the subject."" According to King, you ""must have a passion and ambition that extends beyond simply taking stock of the latest tower.""

6.  PROVOCATIVE

""The critic must be a fighter,"" historian and critic Joseph Rykwert wrote last year. A decade ago, the late ""architecture watchdog"" Allan Temko noted that few contemporary writers appreciate ""activist criticism--the need to get out there and fight with fang and claw."" Critics can use their position to ""make strong propaganda for a real position,"" says Sorkin. They should be ""daring,"" Ho maintains, ""rallying for practices that contribute to a more equitable and sustainable world.""  Kamin contends that ""a critic doesn't just conclude the conversation--he/she can start it."" 

7.  PUBLIC

""The primary purpose of architectural criticism,"" Kamin declares, ""is to build a bridge between the public and the public realm. Architecture is not a purely private transaction between architects and clients. It affects everyone, so it ought to be understandable to everyone."" Sorkin has called criticism ""a service profession"" whose ""role to assess and promote the positive effects architecture can bring to society and the wider world."" Ho backs this up: ""Ultimately, buildings embody a set of values, and the best critics are those who advocate for values that lift society while helping to advance the art."" 

Using these lenses to look again at the offending articles from the New York Times, I struggle to see what Betsky finds so objectionable. In fact, many of Michael Kimmelman's recent writings--his attack on the lackluster One World Trade Center, his plea to save Paul Rudolph's Brutalist landmark in Goshen, NY, his exposition of Berlin after the fall of the Wall, etc.--capably illustrate the ""seven lamps"" in their tone, timeliness, and relevance. 

It is true that Kimmelman differs noticeably from his two immediate predecessors--Nicolai Ouroussoff (2004-2011) and Herbert Muschamp (1992-2004)--but often those two failed to meet many of the criteria above. In 2010, Lange wrote that Ouroussoff ""has an opinion about design, but his reviews offer not much more than that opinion. His approach--little history, less politics, occasional urbanism--shrinks the critic's role to commenting only on the appearance of the architecture."" And Muschamp was infamous for his ""lack of objectivity"" and ""unapologetic dilettantism"" (New York Observer, 2004). A champion of stylists, he contributed significantly to advancing the careers of many so-called ""starchitects."" His 2007 obituary in the Los Angeles Times highlighted his description of Frank Gehry's Guggenheim in Bilbao as ""the reincarnation of Marilyn Monroe""--it ""likes to let its dress fly up."" 

""Buildings don't exist in a vacuum,"" notes Kimmelman, who won last year's Brendan Gill Prize from the Municipal Art Society of New York. ""They may be remarkable looking and innovative, but they're not sculptures."" All the writers I interviewed emphasize that architecture and its criticism should demonstrate great empathy for the public. In his critique of the Times, however, Betsky insisted that ""architecture is not made by or for 'a wide spectrum of the population.' It is made for those who have the means to commission it, and reflects their values and priorities."" In February, he reiterated this point: ""it is not 'the people' who commission architecture.""

""We've allowed the conversation to drift from social agency,"" Kimmelman told a reporter, not long after taking his post. ""The public conversation about architecture has been dominated by people who shared particular interests in formal and material innovation. These are central issues and fundamental to my job. But there have always been vast numbers of people interested in ... the interaction of formal and social inventions ... who have felt left out of the conversation. So in part, taking over as the Times's critic, I felt that my job should be to broaden the conversation.""

Sounds pretty ""serious"" to me.

It was hot, cold, dirty, muddy, and smelly and most of the time you couldn't even hear the music. But, epic nevertheless.  

Regardless, the culture was shifted as never before and the legacy of Woodstock lives on stamped into the DNA of American culture. 

Fast forward to today's coolest shows and venues: Coachella or Hardly Strictly Bluegrass and you'll find the comforts of home: gourmet food, swimming pools, private jet parking, T1 mobile bandwidth via satellite, private concierge services rivaling the Ritz. 

Today's concert promoter is not handing out apples like Bill Graham used to do at the Fillmore (that's how I met him) they are backstage hanging with the artists and dialing into attendance numbers and concession sales via multiple phones and other devices. 

Boomers are Basking in Convenience When/Where Possible 

Discerning boomers are no different from the millennial generation when it comes to modern accouterments for on the go convenience. 

If you looked around the playa at Burning Man you would see a forest of RVs parked around, with satellite dishes, Air Conditioning on 24/7, and uniformed concierge geeks delivering Sushi on the half shell and porta potties discreetly tucked into convenient locations around the venue. 



Jimmy Buffett is no longer a musician; he's a business tycoon walking in the footsteps of Ted Turner. And, any boomer worth his/her salt at a ""Margaritaville Show"" wants all of the convenience of home, including enough power to drive their blenders in the back rows. 

If you track market share numbers for iPhones you can wager boomers are driving a lot of revenue. Jonny Ivy designed a simple function UI that lets a boomer pull up Yelp without dragging the glasses out of their ever present designer bag.  

How Brands Should Market to Boomers 

Appealing to any audience, boomers included, necessitates an understanding of their buying habits, emotional drivers for purchases, social platforms and historical brand interaction.  

Some not all Boomers, in spite of all the press about not being materialistic are just that. There is a rich history of demographic buying patterns and The Last Whole Earth Catalog farm implements didn't make the final short list. 

They are ""cool hunters"" and any retail brand that wants to capture market share in this aging demographic should factor in style and the cool factor.  

See Steve McQueen, James Dean and Levis marketing in the '70s -- it was as much about style as substance and you can ""borrow"" and ""retrofit"" your marketing (see MadMen: AMC has made a killing) accordingly. 

And, coolness as applied to generating brand relevance is about social construct. Boomers have always and will continue to want peer approval and they love aspirational brands that help them define who they are. It's been and will continue to be about making a statement. And, BTW, some of this is relevant for millenials too. 



Many boomers are as technical as any generation. To them technology not only serves as a communication tool; but, it makes a statement about who they are and it's as ubiquitous and helps to define who they are. Again, see Apple demographics for proof. 

Boomers still love relevant brands. As they have aged, many have not become less concerned with fashion, trends, and what's cool. They still want to try the latest and 'best"" Starbucks confections, buy designer duds and stay up to date and plugged in to the latest technological advances. 

Boomers have always been disposed towards brands that help them express and define their identity. See the brand gestation patterns from Levis to BMW or Mercedes Benz. Boomers value specialty brands that make life better; but, don't always need a brand to define who they are. 

Lest I sound too materialistic driven, boomers have always identified with health, wellness and social activism too. No generation can ""own"" social activism outright, but that cultural thread has clearly resonated with this generation. 

Today, savvy brands that embed some social component are going to do well with boomers. Corporate philanthropy is somewhat cross-generational. 

Any brand that delivers content or messaging around health, wellness and good works will appeal to most consumers. We all embrace these tenants when and where we can and savvy brands should take note. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

The global challenges we face are huge, but at this moment, we have the chance to make huge changes to the world we live in, to make it the kind of world we want to live in.

We have the chance to ensure that women can plan the number of children they want to have, we have the chance to stop women having to face unsafe and illegal abortions and to try to bring about gender equality.

At IPPF, we don't believe that we will ever eradicate poverty or create sustainable development if we don't stamp out inequality between men and women. This is both practical and political.

Women and girls need access to the sexual and reproductive medical services they need but they also need access to their sexual and reproductive rights.

At this moment we stand on the brink -- we have the chance to ensure these fundamental services and rights are included in the next global blueprint which will shape the world over the next 15 years. The stakes couldn't be higher.

The timing is crucial, because at this moment global leaders are finalising the post 2015 framework. These targets that are agreed by world leaders over the next few months will replace the Millennium Development Goals which were agreed in 2000 to last until this year.

This month, the Commission on Population and Development (CPD 48) -- which tracks progress of the Programme of Action laid out in the ground-breaking International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) -- is taking place. It's theme, 'Realizing the future we want: integrating population issues into sustainable development, including the post-2015 development agenda,' and its timing couldn't be more significant.

The original ICPD put women's rights, empowerment and well-being at the centre of discussions about population growth and development and this year -- more than ever -- it's critically important that we stay true to those goals.

Over the last 15 years huge progress has been made. Contraceptive use has increased dramatically, but there remains a huge unmet need and fertility rates remain high in some of the poorest places in the world. In 18 countries, they stand at five children or more per woman, higher than desired fertility rates.

Deaths related to complications in pregnancy and childbirth have dropped by 47 per cent since 1994. Back then, more than half a million maternal deaths occurred each year. But even so, 800 mothers still die each day and the leading causes of those deaths are all preventable.

Life expectancy grew from 64.8 years in 1990-1995 to 70 years in 2010-2015. The greatest increases were in the least developed countries. However, many women continue to die early - often from causes related to pregnancy or poverty and their lower status throughout the world.

But there are grounds for optimism. One being the first ever BRICS (Federal Republic of Brazil, the Russian Federation, Republic of India,  People's Republic of China, and Republic of South Africa) Meeting of Ministers Responsible for Population Matters. IPPF has been working with BRICS governments and with 40% of the world living in BRICS countries, these countries' approach to sexual and reproductive health will make a difference to hundreds of millions of lives.

But many challenges still lie ahead. 

Many adolescents lack basic sexuality education, including how to protect themselves from HIV and AIDS. Fifteen million girls each year married as children. Still women are vulnerable to gender-based violence -- including FGM -- and endure fistula, and are at risk of being infected with HIV.  They still suffer and die from complications of pregnancy and childbirth, and unsafe abortion is still a major cause of maternal death and disability.

We think we need to move the debate even further so we can try to tackle these challenges and at this moment, we have a golden opportunity to do that. Global leaders are joining forces to agree the next set of poverty reduction targets which will replace the ones Millennium Development Goals. 

We are asking them to recognize that the right to sexual and reproductive health and rights are preconditions for social and economic development. And to address the sexual and reproductive health needs of adolescents and young people.

We know that until these conditions are met, the goal of gender equality with full human rights for all won't be reached. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

Judith Kindler, whose work is on view at Melissa Morgan Fine Art in Palm Desert, through May 8th, has been creating collage-paintings that layer and intersperse the artist's personal graffiti with imagery of women and girls, to suggest a kind of accumulation and history. Kindler likes to raise questions, and the central question being asked in her current exhibition is ""Why does each of us feel so strongly that we need to leave our mark, and to be seen?"" 

I recently interviewed Judith Kindler and asked her about her background, her themes and her methods. 

John Seed Interviews Judith Kindler



Judith Kindler

JS: Tell me a bit about your early background and education.

JK: I grew up in a creative family in Western New York.  My grandfather designed furniture and my mother - interiors.  It became second nature for me to have a calling in the home furnishings industry, which I did for close to 20 years as an adult.  However my family referred to me as ""the artist,"" at a very early age, because I was always painting. I was interested in the fine arts and studied classical painting, photography, sculpture and installation art at Kent State University.  I was very much influenced by the New York avant-garde early in my life.



The Writings on the Wall,  Mixed Media on panel, 2015, 48"" x 48""

JS: Tell me about your career in applied arts and how you have balanced it with your development as a visual artist.

JK: I left Kent State after the infamous May 4th massacre in 1970. We were all caught up in questioning the real value of the war in Vietnam as our friends were being killed or maimed there and now on campus. So I was very affected by this experience and I traveled to India to meditate in search of meaning.  I always joke about going to India to meditate but coming back a materialist and while the eastern thought continued to lay a ground for interpretations of life for me, I in fact discovered I could have wonderful things made there and bring them back to the US to sell. I always designed, photographed and painted throughout this period in my twenties. I created many things. (Years 20 - 27)

I moved to San Francisco and went on to start my own business in textiles, applying my hand painting directly on cotton and silks imported from India and Thailand. It was a wonderful time and my textiles were distributed through interior design showrooms across the country. They were considered a great innovation in textile design at that time and I was credited for these creations in the local and national press and periodicals often. I went on to create printed and woven fabrics as well. ""The Kavalaris Collection"" of prints based on earlier photo-documentation I did in the palaces of Rajasthan, India won the prestigious National product design ""Roscoe Award"" in textiles. (Years 28 - 40)

I began to design furnishings and interiors as well and ultimately was hired to reposition a large home furnishings chain, ""gentrify"" it if you will, for the burgeoning more upscale market.  I successfully did this and went on to do a similar thing in two other large companies as a senior executive heading up merchandising, marketing, advertising, store design and product design.  I became enmeshed in mass marketing.  While this was all an incredible experience, I was very unhappy in this retail corporate world. (Years 40 - 47)

Through this period of my life I always painted.  It was my therapy. But I made no effort to market my art work.  However, I was building personal creative confidence in my aesthetic judgement through all the products I designed and brought to market as well as the experience gained from designing and developing brands through advertising, store design and marketing.   I had become a critical player in the applied arts world on a very large stage but I hated the politics, the ethics, the back stabbing, etc. that went on.  I was not suited to this environment and despite my successes, I wanted out.   I had also come to challenge many of the ideals of commercialism that I was very much a conductor of.  This background had a big impact on later works of art, for example, ""Consume"" a series of mixed media art I did which included installations.  This series looked at how we define ourselves by what we consume, a subject I was very familiar with and wanted to look at from a sociological point of view through my art. (Exhibitions at Woodside/Braseth Gallery and Center of Contemporary Arts In Seattle with exhibition catalog, 2006)

After a move to the Northwest in my late 40's I made the decision to leave corporate life and focus solely on my art and began to sell my work. I became a professional artist.  I loved the singular purpose of just creating a unique work of art or thematic body of work based on the cultural stories or personal experiences of the time or informed by my past experiences.



Behind the Screen,  Mixed Media on two panels, 2015, 24"" x 48""

JS: What are the most important themes of your recent work?

JK: When one looks through the history of my work, especially since 1996, there is much that speaks to the nature of our psychological needs, and really turns inward in narrative but mindful of the common threads that connect us all in our dramas of life. There also is reference to the challenges of political extremism prevalent, along with nostalgic references to previous times socially and personally. The figure has always had a prominent role in my work. Every body of work I do stems from a desire to explore some element of the sociologies, actions, emotions of people, of ourselves.

In this new work (I CAN SEE YOU) I am turning outward sociologically to the need of us all to leave a mark on our society, our world - symbolized in this work, by the proliferation of graffiti.  Through questioning the morality of all graffiti I want to challenge us to look at this need to be seen from a historical, psychological and cultural point of view.  

I did an extensive photoshoot of the old worn walls covered in graffiti and ripped posted political bills, in Venice, Italy. I felt that by capturing these marks and the history of worn surfaces, I was appropriating the appropriated.  In this body of work I bring my own graffiti adding imagery photographed in my studio of both innocent and provocative women and girls that now become part of the accumulative story told on these walls. Through this I have become part of an unknowing collaboration. I pose the question - Can you see me?

Celebration,  Mixed Media on panel, 2015, 24"" x 48""



JS: Can you describe one of your recent works in terms of imagery and possible meanings?

JK: I woke up one morning and I had this image in my mind of an old wall covered with many legs wearing red stilettoes, moving about against this wall.  This became the pivotal work for me titled ""22 Legs"".  The idealism and iconic objectification of the ""perfect"" legs blended against the old decaying background of this old wall...the legs becoming graffiti on the wall...aging, wearing out yet perfect, beautiful - suggests we also have our scars, we are also wearing out.  What meaning is there to our obsessions with brands, with perfection?



22 Legs,  Mixed Media on two panels, 2015, 48"" x 96""

JS: What are your working methods?

JK: I work in numerous media. In this work it all starts with photography.  First an elaborate shoot in Venice Italy of the walls of Venice, I did some years ago.  Add to that, numerous composed studio shots of various models.  I take these elements and blend them together within a digital environment, digitally altering and painting effects that I want to add or subtract.  Then the work is printed out on archival large scale pigment printers in my studio on canvas where I can control the outcome.  The canvas is mounted to custom built wooden panels.  Then I begin to paint on the surface - layers of classical glazing techniques, or painted additions, mark making etc. until I achieve the feeling I am going for.  Then there is between 6 to 12 layers of over glazing with a transparent thick media that is both tactile when fully cured, as well as having perfect clarity and a glossy effect that dramatizes the imagery below the glaze. (It is not, however, a rigid surface like resin.)



Ripped Bills,  Mixed Media on panel, 2015, 48"" x 48""

JS: What are your interests outside of art?

JK: Golf, cooking, entertaining, philanthropy in the visual arts, sociology 

JS: Is there anything else you would like to say about your current exhibition?

JK: There is a more in depth explanation of the exhibition in the online catalog of (I CAN SEE YOU) that one can check out on my website.  At the end of the catalog or on that same web page is a link to a video where I talk about the work as well.

Above all, we have begun to understand the biological intelligence of nature itself that, for millennia, has managed to continually regenerate and stabilize that narrow band of a livable climate that has enabled our species and others to thrive. 

Working with nature, not against it, to combat climate change is the message of the Leo DiCaprio-narrated short video documentary, ""Restoration,"" we publish this week. As senior Chinese diplomat Wu Jianmin writes from Beijing, we are also learning to work together as nations through geo-environmental cooperation, as exemplified by the recent U.S.-China agreement to jointly reduce carbon gases. 

Such cooperation, though, is not yet in the cards for India, writes Chaitanya Kumar, who scores the contradiction between Prime Minister Modi's high rhetoric but official inaction on climate change.

Our Singularity University series this week asks what might happen as the advance of technology enables humans to ""rewrite nature."" Princeton's Charles Rubin says it is high time to move beyond ethical qualms about artificial intelligence and set real standards. ""Without ethical standards,"" he writes, ""there is no progress -- only change."" Fusion  examines whether human and machine intelligence are indistinguishable.

This week European Commission officials filed a landmark complaint against Google for what they regard as the monopolistic abuse of its search engine for shopping sites. Wharton School Professor Eric Clemons declares ""it's about time"" Google was brought to heel. In an interview, Noam Chomsky  tells Seung-yoon Lee that ""I don't look at Twitter because it doesn't tell me anything.""

As Greece runs out of money and its European partners are unrelenting  on debt relief, Theodoros Arapis expects the Greek reforms will fail. Writing from Berlin, Hertie School of Governance Professor Mark Dawson, referring to recent riots against austerity policies, asks why Europeans are trying to burn down their Central Bank. Writing from Paris, French philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy calls the familial feud within the National Front a ""pathetic farce"" since nothing in its far-right and racist character has changed. Lee Daniel Kravetz reflects on the memory  of the German novelist and activist, Gunter Grass, who died this week. Aurélie Ponthieu of Médecins Sans Frontières writes that countries around the Mediterranean must urgently ramp up their joint rescue efforts as the humanitarian crisis of migrants drowning at sea escalates.

Dr. J. Phillip London undoubtedly made tough decisions during his 23-year tenure as CACI International Inc.'s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) -- and his continuing role as Chairman of the Board.  During his tenure and afterwards, Dr. London's commitment to moral/ethical leadership and character development is evident in his work.  These experiences are key factors in his latest pursuit, which is personally significant, can impact someone's future (positively or negatively), and is a reflection of an individual's beliefs.  Dr. London's latest quest addresses the important topic of character and its relationship with success.

Dr. London's character development is the result of being raised by good parents who were upright citizens, good people, hardworking, self-reliant, and had strong spiritual perspectives.   His father emphasized during his developmental years the importance of this line from William Ernest Henley's poem Invictus: ""I am the master of my fate; I am the captain of my soul.""  This phrase stressed to him the importance of an individual's ownership and control over their destiny.  This concept also brought clarity and perspective to the significance of everyone being personally responsible and accountable for their choices -- along with the outcome(s) of their action(s).

These strong role models developed his character's foundation, which was further advanced during his time affiliated with the Naval Academy.  While at the academy, he learned the importance of time, the idea of mutual respect, commitment, integrity, trust, and being accountable to others to fulfill his duty.  Moreover, he believes that an individual's character is a key component of living a purposeful life -- as individuals for the most part want to be proud of the things done and satisfied with the things accomplished.

In his latest book Character: The Ultimate Success Factor, Dr. London writes about the subjects of character, ethics, and integrity.  This book is the result of his desire to create material about the importance of ""doing the right thing"" for internal use at CACI.  However, as he began to write, he realized that there were increasing societal challenges related to character weaknesses and flaws.  This realization drove Dr. London to write a comprehensive book about the role of character in the achievement of success, which isn't solely based on material achievements but also the way the success is achieved.  For example, did you: give it your best effort; appreciate those who worked in your environment; do your best with the available opportunities?  The answers to these questions reflect a personal philosophy or belief system for individuals to develop their moral and ethical character for humanity's benefit.

Dr. London was fortunate to have a few outstanding role models who helped to shape his core beliefs and character.  Although, he understands that everyone doesn't have good role models.  Notwithstanding, deficits of moral leadership in an individual's life don't abdicate their responsibility to ensure that their actions are ethical, legal, moral, and socially responsible.  Anyone who doesn't have a positive role model can read about historical figures (e.g., military leaders, spiritual advisors, or civil rights leaders) to develop their moral framework based on individuals who are known for steadfast character.  This process can be used as a moral compass to develop themselves by choosing a respected authority who has similar values that can be used for personal development.

The good news for anyone who has had ""character missteps"" is that per Dr. London, ""We're all mortal and we all have failures.  The important thing is do you subscribe to the notion of character and commit yourself willingly to work on it throughout your life.""  Individuals must understand that a mistake at a moment in time isn't always indicative of future behavior.  Continuing this topic, Dr. London added, 

I believe in forgiveness, I believe in the notion of character consideration of expressing remorse, of being apologetic and I believe in all these notions.  I believe that people have to be able to get up from falling down and proceed on and correct and enhance their lives.

Individuals can turnaround character mishaps, but according to Dr. London, ""turning things around for an individual takes a recognition that you're on the wrong course.""  For organizations, there must be a similar realization that turnarounds can begin at any level; although, there needs to be a commitment and desire by organizational leaders to make the necessary change(s).

Dr. London recommends that anyone who is in a questionable organization discuss their concerns.  By expressing their misgivings, individuals can take a stand to protect their organizations and themselves.  Then, if organizational leaders aren't willing to make adjustments (change), then individuals might consider removing themselves from that environment.  As stated by Dr. London, there aren't any acceptable times for individuals to compromise on their ethical character by doing something dishonest.  

As for the importance of choice in character development, Dr. London's advice for individuals who face tough moral or ethical decisions is to ""Believe what you're doing; believe that you're doing the right thing.  Belief is a core idea -- the way I see it -- not a mechanical process.""

Dr. London also added, ""Success is an internal reward for how you have carried out your life, carried on your business, carried on your life with others.  It's more of a personal issue, than it is a material issue; it's not material... it has nothing to do with materiality"".  In recent times, he has reported on the apparent increase of a ""win at any cost mentality"".  Moreover, he added that previous societal advances weren't based on these types of negative perspectives.  Therefore, he's trying to inject his notion of values and doing the right things into societal views.

Another important consideration is for individuals to think about the impact of their activities on others -- including unintended consequences.  Dr. London wants individuals to recognize that we're in this together and that character sensitivity, appreciation, and respect are necessary for the advancement of our civilization.

It's also about driving and developing strong cultures to deliver the very best you can based on high standards, values, integrity, doing the right thing, and trying to do the very best for your clients.  At CACI, Dr. London states that there is an ethos and culture to get things resolved as soon as possible, along with an intent and commitment to do things ethically.

Dr. London writes in his book, ""Achievement can be defined in terms of wealth, power, or fame.  Likewise, it can be defined in terms of social welfare and individual fulfillment.""  This definition of success is different than traditional measurements.  Notwithstanding, this additional extension of success is useful to help individuals understand that 'winning' doesn't always have a material representation; instead, success can be achieved by the implementation of moral and ethical beliefs.  By helping individual's understand alternative measurements of success, this growing trend of 'winning at any cost' can be reversed or stopped.

Dr. London emphasized that a positive attitude is an important character attribute.  He states, ""The idea of a positive view is a really important one.  The sooner you wrap your life with positive perspectives ... the more likely you are to succeed and the happier you'll be. ... It will be a more satisfying experience for people.""

The important work that Dr. London does to raise individual, organizational, and societal character attributes is commendable.  Nonetheless, this mentality must be taught on an ongoing basis in homes, schools, communities, organizations, and other entities.  Ultimately, everyone is responsible for their own character development; although, individual choice(s) can have an impact on humanity's character evolution.

While making a choice whether to behave morally or ethically, remember that real and impacting success isn't measured by short-term individual gains.  Societal success is a partial result of individual actions, but real and lasting success is driven by the cumulation of positive individual characters and choices.

My personal takeaway from Dr. London is that character development is a lifelong pursuit.  There must be a willingness to admit to mistakes, take a step back, and make a conscience decision to work toward self-improvement.  The key message is that it's not about perfection, but something that's being worked toward.  Developed character isn't a state or destination, but it's always a personal choice.

Back in the 1970s, a spate of newspaper stories claimed that unscrupulous college kids and law school grads were borrowing money from the government without planning to pay it back, knowing that they could just go to court and weasel out of their debts before they had any real assets to lose in the bargain. But, unsurprisingly, the reporting turned out to be mostly anecdotal trash that was later debunked in a study commissioned by Congress.

Discover entrepreneurs that are innovating the world around us in fashion, culture and technology. 

Recently, I had the pleasure of sitting down with one of the most amazing women that I have met to date, Paula ""Pixie"" Dezzutti Hewlette. Don't let her nickname, ""Pixie"", fool you. It's not often that you meet a woman who has decided to turn a very male-dominated industry upside down through patented technology and an out of the box approach to giving back to the local community. Dezzutti Hewlette has not only raised nine children of her own, but accomplished this while starting and running several businesses, creating new strategies for American Express, studying theology, developing real estate and finally, launching a spirits company for social good. Her ability to succeed in everything she chooses to do is admirable and her passion for helping others is contagious. Take a moment to get to know a very extraordinary woman who continues to revolutionize normal. 

NOVA LORRAINE: You are truly a Renaissance Woman when it comes to innovation, entrepreneurship and building brands. What are some of your greatest accomplishments to date?

DEZZUTTI HEWLETTE: All of the pieces of my journey seem to have been the building blocks necessary for the foundation of each life lesson I have managed to master. When you have an insatiable appetite for wanting to ""experience more"" you tend to take on pretty lofty challenges. I think taking on the responsibility of bringing  almost a dozen children into this world in today's environment, with the commitment of having them all be independent and successful individuals who contribute demonstratively to society, was a pretty big feat. However, pursuing my education in business and finance even when it meant traipsing all over the world to learn from the best of the best with a bunch of kids in tow, still impresses me to this day. I don't know how I did it, except to say I had divine help! Launching my financial planning practice, which still serves its clients today with the same dedication it did three decades ago, is a reflection of how much I have been able to improve the financial well-being of those who depend on me to lead them. And of course, I feel the creation of  Local Choice Inc, as a platform to change the world through an improved business model of partnerships, equality and sharing, will ultimately be recognized for its disruptive, exemplary contribution to furthering the embracement of diversity in big business.


NOVA LORRAINE: Your experience after college eventually led you to be a game changer at American Express. How did that door open for you and what legacy did you leave behind at American Express?

DEZUTTI HEWLETTE: I first came to American Express through a financial advisor my parents were using that was helping me start a savings plan from my teacher's salary. He was so impressed with how I was able to manage kids, school, teaching and still put money away enough to buy a house at 23 years old and start a savings plan for retirement. He said if I could do that by age 23, I should be teaching others how to do it too! I interviewed the next day and was faced with my first abrupt brush with discrimination in a job interview. I was a woman, I was pregnant, I wasn't even old enough to legally rent a car, and I had scored higher on their aptitude entrance test than any other candidate. They offered to double my teaching salary and I was in management by the end of my first year. Through the years I formed a  joint practice with my husband at the time and we operated a legal division of American Express called Dezzutti & Dezzutti. This was one of the most rewarding times of our lives. He was always very supportive of me and was instrumental at continually pointing out to me how big I was and how I had what it took to do anything. I was lucky to have such encouragement during this critical point of growth in my life. 


NOVA LORRAINE: For so many people, their passions take them to many places around the country and sometimes the world. After your time with American Express, you left Connecticut and headed to Florida.  From an entrepreneurial perspective, how did you spend your time in Florida?

DEZZUTTI HEWLETTE: Making the move to Florida was bittersweet. I was leaving what I loved in the Northeast, but I was also getting to be closer to my parents, who had also recently moved South. My parents and I have always been inseparable and losing my dad a couple of years ago has made my connection to my mom even so much more poignant. So looking after their needs was always important to me. My sister, JoAnn, also relocated to Florida, even before my parents, so wanting to be able to have a place to stay when I visited them naturally led me into the next logical career path: mortgage broker and real estate developer. I hooked up with a developer in West Palm Beach and convinced him to let me partner with him on building some new homes in a development in Royal Palm. 


NOVA LORRAINE: The entrepreneurial bug kept biting and you have found yourself now leading a very unique company in South Carolina. How has building a business, in an industry dominated by men, played out for you?

DEZZUTTI HEWLETTE: Given the past foundation building blocks we have been referring to, I happen to be particularly comfortable in this predominantly male space. I think more challenging than me being a woman in a man's space, is me acting like a woman in a man's space. My model is founded on giving and nurturing. Women are biologically and socially more compassionate and nurturing than their male counterparts on first glance. The alcohol industry takes on a male persona in general. Most brands are named after men and most cocktails are named after women. It's kind of like sports and cars. Since we have been conditioned as a culture to think of men in spirits as moonshiners, and women in spirits as witchcraft sorcery, it's been really challenging and amusing for this spirit guru aptly named ""Pixie"" to be taken seriously. Innovation is thwarted and the system is so archaic, it is almost impenetrable. I am about disruption, diversity and divinity and through those avenues we will change this industry -- because the whole will always be greater than the sum of its parts!


NOVA LORRAINE: Being a guru in brand building, what are three key facts other entrepreneurs should keep in mind when launching their own brand?

DEZZUTTI HEWLETTE:
1. Be Yourself First. Make sure your own unique ability is shining through in your brand building. Think Mahatma Gandhi.

2. Be a Leader. Passion will rise and wane, but purpose will never be extinguished. Think Martin Luther King, JR.

3.Be a warrior. Energy is neither created nor destroyed, it simply transfers form. Think of Nelson Mandela.

NOVA LORRAINE: What are the most important goals that you want to accomplish over the next 3 years?

DEZZUTTI HEWLETTE:
1. Raise millions of dollars for local communities across the USA. Local Choice has been trademarked as a ""for community profit"" foundation promoting local products and services with a humanitarian twist.

2. Release my Baby Boomer Bourbon for causes such as the W.I.S.E. program. Since its inception in 1984, Wise programs (Women in Science and Engineering) have propelled organizations to inspire women and girls to pursue S.T.E.M. subjects as pathways to exciting and fulfilling careers.

3. Begin my speaking tour and finish my book. Laughter Thru Tears has been a book in the making for over a decade now. My greatest desire is to share my story with as many people who want to listen and empower them to create possibility wherever they find themselves in life. 


NOVA LORRAINE: How did you overcome your single most difficult challenge in your career?

DEZZUTTI HEWLETTE: I cried it out! Then I cried it out some more; and then I remembered, big girls don't cry... they think! So by all means, experience your experience. Cry, fight, retreat, defect, get angry and wallow in the depths of despair. These emotions themselves are not obstacles to your progress. And don't let your opponent tell you differently. Efforts to suppress emotional reactions that are part of your innate response mechanism only serve to magnetize you to situations that trigger more of the same. It was Carl Jung who first said ""What you resist persists"" and many teachers have expanded that by going on to say ""What you resist persists...and what you accept changes.""

There are so many channels for people to communicate on, and it feels like almost everyone has a blog, a podcast, or is self-publishing a book. So, in this crowded environment, how do certain ideas break through?  

That's what author Dorie Clark answers in her new book Stand Out: How to Find Your Breakthrough Idea and Build a Following Around It. She interviewed over 50 thought leaders in a cross section of fields to learn best practices and distill them down so regular professionals can get more attention for their best ideas.

""We've heard the phrase, average is over,"" says Clark. 

If you want create genuine job security and genuine career security for yourself, you have to give people a reason to want to work with you more than other people and make sure your best ideas get noticed.

Clark says that one of the big problems today is that people still believe their good ideas should stand on their own and don't need to be promoted -- that the cream will rise to the top. But today, because of how much competition is out there, that's becoming less and less true. 

People need to understand that it's important to spread the word about their ideas. They need to feel confident about how to do that in a way that is not sleazy. Instead, it needs to be authentic and in service of good ideas, not just sheer self-promotion.

So how can individuals get noticed when they are just starting out? Clark explained that since many people don't know exactly what they want to do or where to begin looking for their breakthrough idea, the first half of the book is dedicated to five major processes that will help you discover your big idea. The second half is about how to build a following around the idea once you have it.  

To come up with an idea that really makes a difference in your field, the first thing is to focus on a niche and then expand it out. The second is addressing yourself to a big challenge that really matters to the world. Third, combine ideas so one field can bring ideas to another. The fourth major process is conducting original research. ""In a world with so much opinion it's actually rarer and rarer to find firsthand fact, and that can set you apart,"" Clark says.

The last major process is create a framework, which is how psychologist, Robert Cialdini, stood out. ""We might assume that for many fields the framework is set, that everything that could be said has been said,"" Clark explains, ""but interestingly enough, until Robert Cialdini, 20 or 30 years ago, said hey, there are only 5 or 6 strategies that people use in influence and persuasion, nobody really thought about it that way.""

Then what do you do once you have the breakthrough idea? Clark offered three tips on how to stand out and make your idea spread:

Become a Connector
One great way to offer value to people is connecting them with others that they might benefit from. ""This builds your reputation as a giver,"" Clark explains, ""and creates a powerful community that surrounds you and is grateful to you but isn't about you."" Take, for example, Peter Shankman, a PR executive who often had journalists call him and ask for sources. It felt good to help out and it built up his favor with reporters, whom he needed to cover his own clients. Eventually, the requests became overwhelming though and he built an email list called Help a Reporter Out (HARO) that sent out the journalist requests to his community that might be able to help.  By 2010, the list had grown to 300,000 people, and was  earning ad revenue.  With his name attached to this valuable service, it gave Shankman invaluable exposure in his own right and he was able to launch his own business as an author, speaker and consultant.

Build a Platform
Peter Shankman connected two groups in a direct, effective way that nobody had done before, but you can also expand that idea to create an active community where you help others build relationships in a broader way to solve a problem. Scott Belsky had just that vision and went to business school to build a platform to ""help organize the creative world"" and better connect artists so they could learn from one another. Belsky launched Behance where creatives could upload their portfolios, allowing them to get feedback and gain exposure. Behance became the first widely popular portfolio site and by 2012 had grown to more than a million members.  

Make it Fun 
""As you think about making an impact with your work,"" Clark says, ""its also essential to ask yourself: how can we create something that people can't wait to participate in? This is the insight that propelled Boston non-profit fundraiser Robbie Samuels to his professional success.""  

Samuels started a meetup group in Boston called Socializing for Justice where ""twice a month, nonprofit advocates and their friends would gather for a purely social event -- Bowling for Justice, Cocktails for Justice, Knitting for Justice and the like. Over the past eight years SoJust has grown to more than 2,400 members because of the welcoming, fun style of bringing people together. ""In the much-heralded 'attention economy,'"" explains Clark, ""it's more important than ever to ensure that people opt in - that you're creating something so valuable, they choose to seek it out.""  Besides connecting countless professionals, the success of the group helped Samuels launch a side business, providing training for universities and nonprofits on his style of networking. As Samuels told Clark, ""I love teaching and doing trainings and I don't think I would have known where to start if I hadn't had the groundwork [of SoJust].""

In today's world, it's not the best ideas that get noticed, it's the people who make themselves known.  Understanding how you stand out is key to your career success whether you're an entrepreneur or an employee in a big company.

Fortunately, there's a key that's not often discussed but has a huge impact on the longterm potential of every partnership. It's the quality of respect. 

When relationships break down, you can bet the respect has already gone out the window. Either we stopped treating ourselves with respect and our lover followed suit; or, we lost respect for our partner, and the trust and passion went downhill from there. 

So rather than trying to figure out all the different components of how to make love last, focus instead on creating an atmosphere of respect with your partner. The more you can do this, the more other vital elements of the relationship, like trust, intimacy, passion, love, and so on, will naturally flourish. 

Here are five practical ways to begin increasing the level of respect in any relationship: 

1. Take your own life seriously. Your health, your finances, your career, your mental and emotional wellbeing. It's your responsibility (not your partner's) to ensure that you are functioning as a healthy adult. 

This doesn't mean you have to be perfect or that you can never receive support from your partner. In fact, it's vital that you're able to receive as graciously as you give. 

But what taking your own life seriously means is that you take the initiative for keeping your own life on track. You keep your body in decent shape and visit the doctor when you need to. You work towards paying off credit card debt and saving for retirement. You visit a therapist to heal old wounds rather than treating the relationship like your emotional dumping ground. You stay engaged with friends and activities you love. 

When you respect yourself enough to take your own needs and responsibilities seriously, you set an important precedent of healthy accountability and build an atmosphere of self-love that will benefit and intrigue you both. 

2. Express gratitude. Every day, look your partner in the eyes and say, ""thank you"" when he does even the simplest thing to make your day nicer. It's amazing how easy it is to take those closest to us for granted. A simple, but thoughtful expression of gratitude will help you remember how special it is to have someone care about you. And, it will ensure your partner feels acknowledged and appreciated. 

3. Be real. When challenges arise between the two of you, avoid cheap ways of discharging your pain by name-calling, eye rolling, sarcasm, ignoring him or being intentionally hurtful. Try this instead: Take a deep breath and place your hands over your stomach or your heart (whichever helps you connect with yourself more) and notice what you're truly feeling. Try communicating that instead -- without all the drama. You can simply tell your partner, ""I need to be quiet for a while and sort out my thoughts."" Or, you could say, ""I feel really helpless and afraid right now."" 

It takes practice to become clear about your true emotions and then to express them simply. But taking steps towards authentic communication will build respect, create trust, and open the space for exciting new possibilities to unfold in your relationship. 

4. Focus on what you do respect about your partner. Is your man great at his job? Does he have a kind, compassionate heart? Is he a committed father? What you focus on expands and this is definitely true in our relationships. When you intentionally choose to admire and appreciate your partner, you will begin to notice more and more of the things that make you feel proud to be with him.

5. Accept that your partner has legitimate needs. Just like you, your man will need emotional and physical safety, regular touch and closeness, a sense of purpose, solitude, recognition, etc. When we spend a lot of time with someone, we can forget that he is a separate individual with valid needs of his own. We see this often when a woman dismisses her husband's drive for sexual intimacy or his need to zone out for a while after work. 

If we want our man to fully show up for us, we need to give sincere consideration to what he's expressing (verbally or non-verbally) about what his needs are. This doesn't mean that we put his needs above our own - it means we see him, we communicate respectfully, and we genuinely work together to make sure everyone has what they need to thrive.

Our research lab is studying the town to learn how these technologies might help communities around the world become more responsive to their citizens. This is a brief report on what we know so far.

For the last four years, a town in southern Spain has been conducting a remarkable experiment in civic life. Jun (pronounced ""hoon"") has been using Twitter as its principal medium for citizen-government communication. Leading the effort is Jun's Mayor, José Antonio Rodríguez Salas, a passionate believer in the power of technology to solve problems and move society forward.

Since launching the initiative in 2011, Rodríguez Salas has been recruiting his 3,500 townspeople to not only join the social network but have their Twitter accounts locally verified at town hall. This extra step isn't necessary to participate in the conversation -- Twitter is open to anyone -- but it helps town employees know they're dealing with actual residents.

In the most basic scenario, a citizen who has a question, request or complaint tweets it to the mayor or one of his staff, who work to resolve the matter. For instance, in the sequence of tweets shown below (which we pulled from the 2014 Twitter data and translated into English), at 10:48 pm a citizen tells the mayor that a street lamp is out on Maestro Antonio Linares Street. Nine minutes later, the mayor replies that he'll have the town electrician fix it the next day. The mayor's tweet includes the Twitter handle of the electrician, who is automatically notified that he's been mentioned and sees the exchange. That tweet is a public promise that the town will indeed take action, and to underline this it ends with the hashtag #JunGetsMoving. The next day, the electrician tweets a photo of the repaired fixture, thanking the citizen for his help and repeating the hashtag.

A citizen alerts the mayor to a broken street lamp. Two tweets later, it's fixed.


Governments have been responding to citizens for centuries. But digital networks have made it possible to build much faster, more efficient feedback loops. Each of the participants in the above transaction wrote a single text of less than 140 characters, and in less than 24 hours the problem was solved.

There are numerous cases of public officials responding to tweets. U.S. Senator Cory Booker made headlines several times for doing so when he was mayor of Newark, New Jersey. For a big city U.S. mayor, this was considered unusual behavior and therefore newsworthy. In Jun, however, it has been systematically adopted as the way things get done every day. If Rodriguez Salas didn't respond to an urgent citizen tweet, it would make headlines.

Because these communications occur on a public social platform, they can be seen by everyone in the community. This ""mutual visibility"" (sometimes called ""mutual transparency"") serves as both a carrot and a stick. On one hand, the government's performance comes under greater public scrutiny. If a broken streetlight isn't fixed, everyone knows it and the slacking employee is more likely to be disciplined or, if it becomes a pattern, fired. That's the stick.

But the good work done by public servants is also now visible to all and thus more likely to be recognized and rewarded. The carrots can be as small as a message being favorited or retweeted (the electrician received both), or as great as winning the esteem of one's neighbors and new status in the community. The operator of the town's street-sweeping machine, whose entertaining tweets have made him a local celebrity, told us that having his daily work seen and appreciated on the social platform has changed his life.

According to the mayor, this system is saving the town time and money. Tweeting is quicker than fielding and returning phone calls, which used to consume his day. He says these efficiencies have allowed him to reduce the police force from four employees to just one. Jun's sole police officer told us he now receives 40 to 60 citizen tweets per day, ranging from the serious (there's been a bad car accident) to the trivial (my neighbor is singing at all hours, please make him stop). He noted that being accessible to the public on a 24/7 social network has its downsides; to protect his family time, on arriving home in the evening he turns off his phone. But what if there's an emergency, we asked. Answer: It's a small town and everyone knows where he lives.

Jun citizens also use Twitter to voice their views on local issues. At town council meetings, which are streamed live on the web, those not physically present may participate by tweeting questions and comments, which appear on a screen in the council chamber.

Beyond government, the social network is broadly integrated into the town's everyday life, used for a wide variety of tasks such as publicizing social and cultural events, booking medical appointments, following youth sports teams, and just keeping up with neighbors. The town employee who tweets the school lunch menu each weekday told us on that on weekends she enjoys sharing some of her family's home life via tweets. One retiree who learned to use Twitter at a technology education center run by the town said the network has become his principal news source. ""It's just like a newspaper!"" he enthused, noting that the mayor tweets so often about national and global events, he's a one-man media outlet.

Jun essentially runs on Twitter, a groundbreaking use of social technology that, as far as we know, is unique. All over the world, digital technologies play a growing role in community management. In their book, The Responsive City, Stephen Goldsmith and Susan Crawford write about ""the emerging cadre of officials and civic activists who are using the new data tools to transform city government"" in Boston, Chicago, New York and elsewhere. The New York City police department recently started using Twitter to connect with citizens. But Jun is the first community to use a social medium comprehensively for all civic communication. And it happened in an entirely home-grown way. For the first couple of years, Twitter the company was not even aware of the experiment.

Our academic research group at the MIT Media Lab, the Laboratory for Social Machines, was founded last fall with a generous grant from Twitter, and one of us has a work relationship with Twitter. But the company doesn't select or shape our research projects, and our interest in Jun is ultimately not about one platform: It's about the future of all social media and their potential to reshape how communities large and small work. For studying these questions, Jun is an ideal laboratory, small enough that you can get a holistic feel for the place in a couple of days, and large enough that over time, through data analysis and on-the-ground research, meaningful lessons can be extracted. That's our hope, anyway.

Many of the Jun citizens we interviewed told us that the initiative has had a net positive effect on the town. ""Twitter is a plus, it makes the town better,"" one said. Another noted that ""it's an easy and fast way to connect"" and that ""people can build on each others' comments.""

But it is not without its critics. One resident said he dislikes the way the mayor uses Twitter for self-promotion, and how town employees tend to parrot everything the boss says. The same person feels public servants shouldn't use their accounts to tweet about personal matters (""I don't care that they had paella for dinner."") Last time Rodríguez Salas ran for reelection, his opponent urged citizens to vote ""for a real mayor, not a virtual one.""

The mayor himself has a few problems with the system. He jokingly calls Twitter ""the Society of the Minute"" and says it has a way of making citizens more impatient with government. ""In the real world, one in every 43 people has a problem with everything. On Twitter, it is one in 27"" -- and they always expect an immediate response.

He notes that complicated public issues are difficult to discuss on Twitter because of its format. He also acknowledges that his ad hoc method for managing the incoming -- checking his phone often and responding right away -- could probably be improved. Somewhat miraculously, he's been governing the town with Twitter and virtual duct-tape, and perhaps could use a data-driven dashboard that organizes it all.

For a clearer perspective, we have begun analyzing Jun's Twitter data, along with other town records, from the beginning of the initiative to the present. Among the questions we're seeking to answer: Is public engagement on the rise as result of the experiment, and is the demographic composition of the conversation changing? Do citizens vote and attend town meetings more than they did in the past? Are public issues solved more efficiently? Has the use of this tool simply amplified old ways of governing Jun, or has mutual visibility shifted it in some fundamental way, perhaps towards decentralization?

We don't yet have the answers, but an initial mapping of the Twitter data has begun opening a new window on the town. In the screen shots below of a data explorer being developed by Martin Saveski, a graduate student at the Laboratory for Social Machines, each circle represents a Jun citizen or organization. The lines between the circles represent Twitter follower relationships. The larger the circle, the more ""important"" the position occupied by that person in the network (for this measure of Twitter importance -- by no means the only meaningful kind of importance in the community -- we used PageRank, Google's original algorithm for ranking web pages). The four colors denote different sub-networks of people within Jun who are closely tied to each other by their Twitter activity. In each figure, the personal connections of one particular citizen (the white circle) are highlighted, and further details about that person are shown in the box to the right. The first shot focuses on the mayor, the second on the electrician.

For electrician Miguel Espigares (the white circle), the picture is different, reflecting his work and unique role in the town. (Visualizations by Martin Saveski.)


Through such analyses, we hope to gain insights that will help Jun make its system more effective. Our longer-term goal is to determine if it can be replicated at scale in larger communities, perhaps even major cities.

One key question is the leading role played by the mayor, who has held office for the last eleven years and before that was deputy to his father. Throughout those years, Jun was a trailblazer in applying digital tools to democracy, including electronic voting and live-streamed town meetings.

Rodríguez Salas, with his relentless belief in innovation, spearheaded all these efforts. Even before the Twitter experiment, a Spanish newspaper called him ""El Alcalde Digital"" (The Digital Mayor) while a national TV report dubbed the town ""El Increíble Jun"" (The Incredible Jun). He convinced Junians to adopt a new flag with the town motto -- ""Love"" -- spelled out in binary code. Between his personal and official mayoral accounts, he has about 350,000 Twitter followers -- that's 100 times the population of Jun, and about 100,000 more followers than New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio has in his two verified accounts. This is not just any small-town mayor. He also has a warm personality and a common touch. As he walks down the street, a bunch of middle-school-aged boys run up to him shouting, ""Mayor! Mayor!"" and the first thing he does is make sure they're on Twitter and he's following them.

In short, the mayor has an unusual combination of tech sophistication and personal charisma. Is such a leader required for bringing government into the social age? Could the Jun system work in a metropolis with millions of citizens and a different kind of mayor? Rodríguez Salas thinks so and he has ideas about how.

For now, in conversation he returns often to his primary goal: making democracy more transparent and participatory. In his office, where the blue Twitter bird adorns the wall behind his desk (in the spot where a portrait of the Spanish king used to hang), he recently installed glass ceiling panels open to the sky to symbolize the new transparency. The citizens will soon have a chance to pass judgment on his work: In elections next month, they will decide whether to give him another term.

Meanwhile, we'll be digging deeper into the data and sharing what we learn from one town's surprising leap into the socio-political future. Stay tuned.

Larry Upright got in a final swipe this week at the Democratic presidential nominee and former secretary of state with his obituary, which ended, ""Also, the family respectfully asks that you do not vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016. R.I.P. Grandaddy.""

Upright's daughter, Jill McLain, came up with the idea to send one last conservative message for her father, a lifelong Republican. 

""He was very passionate about politics and probably passed a little bit of that on. So it was natural for me to think about that,"" she told ABC News.

Upright died at age 81 on April 13, one day after Clinton launched her presidential candidacy. Retired following a career in the building automation industry, he lived in Kannapolis, North Carolina, which supported Republican nominee Mitt Romney by a 20-point margin over President Barack Obama in the 2012 election.

Clinton, the only Democratic candidate to officially enter the race so far, has spent the last week primarily campaigning in Iowa, where she talked about education with community college students and spoke out against income inequality. According to HuffPost Pollster, Clinton holds a commanding 50-point lead over her potential rivals for the Democratic nomination. She also leads in head-to-head matchups against a slew of possible Republican rivals, including the two current highest-polling GOP contenders: former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

But as this viral invitation to a 1-year-old's first birthday indicates, those days are over.



Redditor razz32 posted the email on April 17 with the heading ""Most demanding 1st birthday invite ever"" after a co-worker, who was one of the original recipients, printed it out and shared it around the office, the user explains in the comments.

The email from the baby's parents begins:
With [name redacted]’s birthday coming up, we thought we’d ask for 4 items that he will really get a lot of use out of in the coming months. I provided my mom and sister-in-law [name redacted] with a list of 4 other items [name redacted] would like for his birthday so that they can buy from their list and avoid duplication. We're asking for gifts only from grandparents and the direct aunt/uncle for [name redacted]'s birthday party, and similar to Christmas, would like to restrict it to 2 items total per household.

The parents then go on to list the four specific items (with links) -- a water table, play tunnel, play tent and “Fill in the Missing Cheerios” book.

But the demands don't end there. The email continues with a few more ""important items"":
- If you choose to get [name redacted] something that isn't on this list, anytime regardless of birthdays or holidays, please be sure to always include a receipt going forward. When we return items without receipts, we only get about 50% of the value, so it is like throwing money away if you don't include a receipt with the gifts. With formula costing us $80 a week, it is always nice to be able to return items that he doesn’t need to get formula instead.
- We would suggest no more books beyond the one Cheerios cited above. Right now, [name redacted] has 32 board books on his shelf, and 25 additional books waiting for him in storage once he is 3+ years of age. (And at this point, he hates when we try reading to him.)
- Please refrain from any personalized gifts that would be used outside of the house. Clothing with names is the #1 thing that leads to kidnapping, so we don't need to broadcast [name redacted] name on clothing or toys.

The parents conclude the letter, ""Please let us know if you have any questions about any items not on this list that you are considering purchasing and we can let you know if we already have it or if it is in storage waiting for him. By the way, a formal invite from [name redacted] will be arriving in your mailboxes soon…""

Best of luck to the party attendees.

It reminds me of a Martin Mull ""middle class blues"" parody years ago, where Mull sang with faux anguish about his martini being too warm.  Pity us poor people of privilege.

At Toronto's Ryerson University a national kerfuffle arose when several white students, claiming to be journalists, were turned away from a campus forum for ""racialized and marginalized"" students.   The students were barred because the event's organizers said they were ""not victims of racialization"" and that the forum's intended participants might be reluctant to discuss their experiences with non-victim students present.   One of the excluded students, Julia Knope, told the Ryersonian, a campus newspaper, ""It seemed really ironic to me that the meeting was about racialization and they were prohibiting certain people from entering.""

Ms. Knope needs a lesson in irony.  It is indeed ironic that a young white woman seemingly cannot see that her sense of entitlement might be the kind of thing that required a forum on marginalization in the first place. 

Another catalyst for this column was a snide Op-Ed in the New York Times by Judith Shulevitz titled, In College and Hiding From Scary Ideas.   Therein she describes a Brown University debate about college rape culture that some students feared might be traumatic to victims of sexual assault.   The debate went forth as planned, but concerned young women organized a ""safe space"" for students who might find the debate unsettling.  

Shulevitz wrote:  

The safe space, Ms. Byron (a concerned student) explained, was intended to give people who might find comments 'troubling' or 'triggering,' a place to recuperate. The room was equipped with cookies, coloring books, bubbles, Play-Doh, calming music, pillows, blankets and a video of frolicking puppies, as well as students and staff members trained to deal with trauma. Emma Hall, a junior, rape survivor and 'sexual assault peer educator' who helped set up the room and worked in it during the debate, estimates that a couple of dozen people used it. At one point she went to the lecture hall -- it was packed -- but after a while, she had to return to the safe space. 'I was feeling bombarded by a lot of viewpoints that really go against my dearly and closely held beliefs,' Ms. Hall said.

Shulevitz went on to claim that our culture ""infantilizes"" young people, allowing them to avoid intellectual or emotional discomfort.   She used several examples that certainly represent political correctness run amok, but her overall theme represents a growing backlash against those who are, or claim to be, victims of racism, homophobia, cultural hegemony, sexual assault or other forms of violence or discrimination.  

Similarly, the Ethical Culture Fieldston School in New York incited a near riot when implementing a mandatory program for middle school kids to discuss race.   Most of the parent objections were to either the mandatory nature of the program or that students would be in ""affinity groups,"" thereby engaging in the very kind of segregation that anti-racist educators are supposed to deplore.   In the view of many entitled white folks, affirmative action is as discriminatory as was slavery, any complaint of bias is ""playing the race card,"" and affinity groups exacerbate racial tension by encouraging separatism.

I'll stipulate that some language in the social justice community can be annoying.   I too sometimes wish folks would stop talking about their ""spaces"" and using other jargon of solidarity.   Engaging in social justice activism shouldn't require tiptoeing through a semantic minefield.  

But is that really the most crushing problem in a society where racism is endemic, sexual assault is epidemic, and homophobia is being codified in state statues in places like Indiana and Arkansas, where the Religious Freedom Restoration Act originally aimed to legalize discrimination against gay folks?

We do indeed have a problem in America with small, exclusive groups of people meeting in secrecy and denying access to others.

But it's not college women who have suffered sexual assault or black students at Ryerson College who meet to share experiences and strategies to navigate the majority culture.   

It's corporate boardrooms.  It's a white-male dominated Congress.  It's fraternities, private clubs and gated communities in our increasingly unjust society.   

Young women seeking safe ""spaces"" or students of color seeking affinity support represent no threat to anyone.   Mocking the young women or claiming that the oppressed are oppressors is just grotesque.

If the donut was becoming newly hip again last year during our first compendium of the best donut shops across the country, it is a full-blown trend now, as artisanal donut shops have risen up like those magical yeasty treats all across America. And though, at times, it can start to feel like the Great Cupcake Trend of 2010, we think the donut revolution has stronger legs to stand on, because -- unlike the cupcake -- it is not an afterthought, but an essential part of your daily morning routine (right, doctors?). 

To that point, we've expanded our list from 21 to 33 this year, keeping many of the strongest shops from last year, and adding an entire roster of new and deserving spots everywhere from Kentucky and Ohio, to Northern California and Virginia. If we missed your favorite, let us know in that bastion of unfettered social democracy known as the comments, but for now, it's time to make (with) the donuts.

Do-Rite Donuts
Chicago, IL
One of the early entrants into the great Chicago donut boom, Do-Rite's a snug downtown take-out counter that was carved out of space belonging to an Italian restaurant, and they're making the most of their modest square footage to turn out donuts that have caused the diet of many a Loop office-drone to go horribly awry (pistachio-Meyer lemon, Valrhona chocolate glazed, candied maple bacon). If that wasn't enough indulgence, their second location brought fried chicken into the mix. Can you get donuts as fried chicken sandwich buns? Yes, yes you can.

The Donut Bar
San Diego, CA
A favorite of our San Diego editor Sara Norris and pretty much anyone who has ever eaten there, Donut Bar gets the call again thanks to that perfect mix of old-fashioned donut-making skills, and an addictive changes-by-the-day menu of new creations that will make you have donut fever dreams for weeks. Of course you can't go wrong with their hand-torched creme brulee, but lately, we've also been somewhat addicted to the glorious fruitiness of their big poppa-tart donut, and the ""oh my peanut butter Oreo,"" which tastes like you mashed up your entire third-grade lunch, covered it in dough, and fried it. In a good way. Such a good way.

Dottie's Diner
Woodbury, CT
You want some high-quality alliteration? Look no further than ""Dottie's Diner, the deluxe destination for delicious donuts!"" And damn if the descriptor and subject of said alliteration isn't correct. Dorothy Sperry's cake-esque creations are now famous in the state of Connecticut and beyond, and for good reason: each made-from-scratch donut is a work of high art (we ate three of the powdered sugar version when visiting), made even more impressive by the fact that the diner serves all the other meals as well, and might be just as known for their positively perfect pies. Sorry, it's addicting.

Dynamo Donut + Coffee
San Francisco, CA
Since 2008, Dynamo has been making the people of that hilly city filled with impossibly expensive condos incredibly happy with Sara Spearin's confection prowess, which results in mad scientist creations like the Bitter Queen (candied ruby grapefruit base topped with a St. Germain elderflower glaze and sprinkled with Campari sugar), chocolate with a raspberry black pepper glaze, and apricot cardamom. Of course, no one will judge if you choose her original vanilla bean with the orange zest either.

Fox's Donut Den
Nashville, TN
If you've been to Nashville and you haven't been to Fox's, FOR SHAME! Just look for that sign showcasing a small Dutch boy wearing a cool hat and holding a donut half the size of his body in Green Hills close to the mall, and immediately go in there and get cherry turnovers and apple fritters and, yes, you can also get regular donuts too. But maybe eat that fritter first.

Glam Doll Donuts
Minneapolis, MN
Teresa Fox's delicious creations are back on the list for a second year. The good people of Minnesota are lucky bastards (NOT during the winter) in that they get to experience her 100% made-from-scratch creations whenever they please. Our current favorites on the list include Bob Seger's favorite Night Moves (blackberry jam, blackberry Hennessy, and brown sugar bits), the Scream Queen (chocolate and caramelized bacon), and our longstanding crush the Chart Topper, which combines peanut butter, Sriracha, and some kind of magically addictive pixie dust.

Glazed and Confused
Denver, CO
Step into some of Denver's finest coffeeshops (Kaladi, Aviano, Pablo's), and you can spot Glazed & Confuzed's donuts pretty easily; aside pastries and muffin varieties so boring even your grandma would pass on them, you'll find their donut-y take on the Girl Scout Samoa with a caramel glaze, toasted coconut, and chocolate drizzle, and the cheekily-named Guava D's Nutz with a cream cheese cake donut and a guava glaze. In mid-2014, the donut boundary pushers behind G&C opened their first standalone shop in Mile High, giving donut lovers even more variety to choose from, where they have the capacity to make crazy donuts like... umm, a Boston Cream Pie. Sometimes the classics can be good too.

Gourdough's
Austin, TX
If, like Subway's Jared, you've always dreamed of eating donuts as sandwiches, you could do much worse than heading to Gourdough's, which has grown in the last couple of years from a trailer operation into a full restaurant, so you can drink real booze while taking down donuts filled with Angus beef and house pimento cheese (the Big Baller), or more traditional options like vanilla pudding, fresh bananas, and vanilla wafers (the Puddin').

Hypnotic Donuts
Dallas, TX
Dallas' desperate need for crazy donut combinations propelled Hypnotic from an operation that only existed in the back of a Ford Explorer to two locations in just four years. Go for the Evil Elvis (peanut butter, bacon, banana, and honey) to see what the fuss is about. Then maybe try the maple-iced Canadian Healthcare that's topped with a giant strip of bacon. And then just test your own healthcare with their equally famous chicken biscuits.

Leonard's Bakery
Honolulu, HI
Because Leonard's is now a two-time winner on our list, their story is worth repeating: back in 1882, two Portuguese immigrants came to Hawaii to work the sugarcane fields. Several years later, their grandson Leonard was born, and several years after that, in 1952, he started his own bakery. On a whim, his Mother suggested they make Portuguese-style malasadas -- essentially donuts with no hole, coated in sugar. Everyone loved them. And thus, a legend -- and, by now, a Hawaiian staple -- was born, and the classic still gets the nod thanks to their made-to-order, piping-hot deliciousness (shhhh, but the custard malasadas are pretty damn good too).

Long's Bakery
Indianapolis, IN
It's been around forever. They only take cash. The lines on the weekend and weekdays and pretty much most of the time are long. But once you get a taste of their glazed yeast donuts, or the blueberry cake, or that apple one that I can only remember in my dreams, you won't mind the lines. And with donuts being under just barely over half a dollar, you won't mind the cash-only policy either.

Loyless Donuts
Cowarts, AL
It's hard to describe Loyless -- not because everything has been said before, because that's certainly not the case for this Southern Alabama institution. Rather, it's almost a caricature of a bygone era: a small-town mom & pop institution where the food is far superior yet much simpler than anything made at the big-box giants. The small town is Cowarts, a town outside of Dothan; you'll find Loyless on the side of Highway 86 underneath towering pine trees. The mom & pop are Eva and Garland Loyless, and their hand-rolled, hand-cut, hand-iced donuts are made every morning. This is old-school America and, if you happen to score one of the few hundred donuts the Loylesses sell each day, typically before 7:30am, you'll realize that old-school America is delicious.

Mojo Donuts
Pembroke Pines, FL
Because the excuse to sing late '90s-era Will Smith isn't quite enough to justify a plane flight to South Florida, there's Mojo Donuts. It may be in a strip mall somewhere between Miami and Fort Lauderdale, but just try the Key lime pie or the s'mores. Trust us.

Nord's Bakery
Louisville, KY
Though we're very into their old-school website, which looks like it was created during the brazen website design year of 2002, the actual donuts at this Louisville bakery are our first love. Do yourself and everyone else in your social circles a favor and opt for the maple bacon long john and a pretzel donut, which is a Midwest specialty that tastes nothing like those things that make the cast of Seinfeld thirsty.

Primo's Donuts
Los Angeles, CA
Since 1956 -- which, in California years, is essentially the dawn of time -- Celia and Ralph Primo's shop on Sawtelle in West LA has been making donuts. And those donuts are delicious. So go there, and buy a mixed dozen, as long as you get at least one buttermilk, a Skippy, a butterfly, a tiger tail, a cinnamon crunch, two twists, and a glazed, and then eat them in front of a SoulCycle, as the ravenous and jealous actors and actresses stream out, and know what it is to fully be alive.

Sweetwater's Donut Mill
Kalamazoo, MI
In the immortal battle between donuts and candy -- which we just made up -- Sweetwater's is basically Switzerland, and not just because of all that chocolate. It's a neutral zone between confections, with donuts that include a devil's food take on peanut butter cups, a nutty Snickers variant, and a dulce de leche Carmello. Meanwhile, butterscotch makes a leap from Granny's cookie jar to donut form, and the caramel apple gives the Dutch a run for their guilders. Since 1983, Sweetwater's has been converting the donut faithful to a world beyond the glazed standbys. But if glazed is your thing, well, they make a damn fine one of those, too.

5033f72b1704fe249cf44720a8cf4525,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-katz-md/is-the-fda-unkind_b_7080926.html,Is the FDA unKIND?,"Chances are, if you have ever ventured just about anywhere outside of your own house, that you are familiar with the increasingly ubiquitous KIND bars. And chances are as well, if that place you call home is anywhere other than under a large rock, you are now aware of KIND's kerfuffle with the FDA.

The FDA is wrong.

Let's be clear: I am a supporter of the FDA. A former commissioner of the agency, and subsequently our former dean of medicine at Yale, is a highly respected colleague and personal friend. I have friends working at the agency now. I have advocated for the agency in various ways on many occasions, visited with scientists there for various reasons, and signed petitions in defense of the funding the agency needs and deserves to do its demanding and important work. But that doesn't change the conclusion here: The FDA is wrong.

I hasten to note that I am also a supporter of KIND. The CEO of KIND, Daniel Lubetzky, is also a personal friend, and quite literally one of the best people I know. Leaving aside the usual stuff -- loving husband, devoted father, and the like -- Daniel has been recognized repeatedly, and appropriately, as a paragon of corporate responsibility. He has made doing the ""KIND"" thing intrinsic to his company's DNA. He runs a global non-profit devoted to, of all things, world peace. I love this guy, and I love the company that embraces his exemplary commitment to honesty, integrity, and genuine virtue.

I append, as well, that KIND has sponsored two studies in my lab, both resulting in peer reviewed publication (the second paper is now in press). But let's be clear: I did not decide I liked KIND because the company funded research in my lab. Rather, they funded research in my lab after I decided I liked them, felt their product deserved to be studied for its health effects, and approached them about sponsorship.

In general, all the wrong concerns tend to be raised about research sponsorship. Anyone who thinks a vested interest should never fund research is something of a hypocrite if they have ever been to a pharmacy; virtually every drug at our disposal got there via pharmaceutical industry research funding.

What matters to the reliability of research findings is the methods that guard against bias, not the existence of bias in funder, or researcher. I have been biased, meaning I was hoping for a particular outcome, with every study I have ever run -- whether the bills were paid by a foundation, a company, the NIH, or the CDC. Why run a study when you don't care how it turns out? I always care, and that, by definition, is bias. We thus build in methods to make sure such inevitable researcher bias does not result in biased research measures.

As for the outcome of those KIND bar studies: Both were positive, demonstrating benefits related to cardiometabolic health, appetite, weight and body composition. The science we have lines up quite well with both common sense, and the company's intentions: These are healthy snacks.

Which brings us back to the conflict with the FDA. In brief, KIND received a letter of reproach from the FDA for use of the word ""healthy,"" on the back and in small print, on four of their snack bar wrappers which in a very specific way fail to qualify, under the FDA definition, for use of that descriptor. What particular way? They exceed the allowable gram of saturated fat per serving.

I have addressed the topic of saturated fat before, more than once, and will spare us any lengthy excursion into those weeds on this occasion. Suffice to say that I agree an excess of saturated fat intake remains a common and relevant concern in the typical American diet, and that FDA rules to help defend against that excess make sense in principle.

But in this case at least, not in practice. The intent of the regulatory language is clearly to guard against the addition of saturated fat per se, as cream, butter, or oil, to a processed food recipe. The pros and cons of that approach could be debated, but it is defensible.

Are there such oils added to KIND bars? Not a drop. Rather, the fat in the KIND bars in question comes entirely from the nuts, notably almonds, which are a major ingredient. So, for instance, KIND almond and apricot bars have 10 grams of total fat, and 3.5 grams of saturated fat, coming almost entirely from the first ingredient, almonds, with perhaps just a tiny bit from the second ingredient, coconut. There is, otherwise, no added oil.

This begs the obvious question: If the fat (and saturated fat) in these KIND bars is the reason they can't be called ""healthy,"" and if this fat (and saturated fat) is entirely, or nearly so, from almonds- does this mean that almonds shouldn't be called ""healthy""?

Any such notion is, of course, absurd. There is a voluminous, robust scientific literature (see citations below) showing that almonds, walnuts, and nuts in general confer consistent and quite significant health benefits. Regular intake of nuts has even been associated with a marked reduction in all-cause mortality risk. If that is not the very definition of ""healthy"" food, I have no idea what could be.

So what's really going on here? The failure of one-size-fits-all-regulation to, in fact, fit all; and the ineluctable law of unintended consequences.

The FDA is a federal agency, and its principal tool is regulatory rules. Dealing with the entire expanse of food and drugs, the FDA tools tend toward the blunt, rather than the surgically sharp. While a numerical threshold for saturated fat as an added ingredient might make some sense, it makes no sense to apply that same regulation to a wholesome, whole food ingredient known to have a healthy overall portfolio of fat content, and decisively good health effects. When almonds, as the first ingredient in a snack, are the reason that snack cannot be called ""healthy,"" you are well into the realm of unintended consequences. I can pretty much guarantee no such occurrence was envisioned when the regulatory language was drafted.

In addition to nuts, by the way, that same standard threshold for saturated fat would preclude calling hummus, wild salmon, or raw avocado ""healthy."" With all due respect to my friends with the feds, that's -- well -- nuts.

One more thing to chew on here. Does anyone think that some agent at the FDA with nothing better to do just suddenly, and spontaneously, decided to scrutinize the back of KIND bar packages on the off chance something in the fine print had gone unnoticed? I don't. I have no inside information here, but I can read the writing on the wall, as well as on a food wrapper. KIND has, as noted, grown all but ubiquitous, and for good reason. While such success fosters many claims of friendship, it fosters even more disgruntled adversaries among competitors losing market share to you. I am pretty sure some such party, looking for any way to slow KIND's momentum, legitimate or otherwise, jangled the FDA's chain. I confess it's just conjecture on my part, but ponder as the spirit moves you.

Almonds are, in fact, healthy. Walnuts are healthy. Nuts in general, hummus, and avocado- are all healthy. KIND bars, too, made principally from nuts and fruit, are healthy. If a regulation on the books precludes saying so, that doesn't make the statement untrue; it makes the regulation inappropriate as applied.

The regulation, though, is the regulation; and the FDA was just doing its job. I don't think the agency was being... unkind. I just think they got it wrong.

e3dd0f83698451d1f960eb5168cdd004,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-thompson/remembering-the-oklahoma_b_7096622.html,Remembering the Oklahoma City Murrah Building Bombing,"On April 19, 1995, Ted Metscher, the president of the Oklahoma Federation of Teachers, was taking his students on a field trip to a downtown hospital.  As the casualties arrived from the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building, Metscher vowed to never push away from the negotiating table.  Before long, union and corporate leaders formed a bipartisan coalition, MAPS for KIDS, to raise taxes to rebuild and to reform our decrepit schools.

Domestic terrorism forced many Oklahomans to rethink their reflexive anti-government ideologies.  The state's casual corruption and colorful examples of scorched earth politics no longer seemed acceptable. MAPS for KIDS became one part of a twenty-year urban revitalization effort, MAPS, that was implemented with a level of collaboration, professionalism, and shared purposefulness that would have previously been unthinkable.

Oklahoma City has been justly praised for its response to the Murrah tragedy.  It was not just the heroism of the first responders, or the dedication of the service providers, and the compassion of our faith communities and volunteers that was transformative.  According to President Bill Clinton, the community ""burned away"" the little things that divide and came to grips with the reality of ""human interdependence.""

Over the last twenty years, the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma City University have also grown more cosmopolitan. Their newfound excellence is demonstrated by the way that they marked the Murrah Anniversary. The O.U. symposium, Terror, Trauma, Memory, and the Murrah Center at the OCU Law School's National Summit on Homeland Security Law, probed the global challenge of domestic and international terrorism.

The conferences' eminent scholars and architects, and political, legal, technology, medical, and security leaders presented a message that went beyond the Oklahoma City experience but which reinforced the lessons that Oklahomans learned from the bombing and its aftermath. As was discussed at O.U., terrorism is often rooted in trauma. Mass murder does not merely inflict suffering; it is also a response, a part of a narrative where the perpetrators try to make sense of their pain and isolation. (That being said, Timothy McVeigh did not seem to have endured trauma that was remotely comparable to other examples of terrorists discussed, especially, at O.U.)

As was further explained at O.C.U. by U.S. Attorney Barry Grissom, it is terrorists who feel disenfranchised who are best able to recruit disenfranchised persons to join their violent conspiracies. Moreover, many of the best practices in fighting terrorism are very similar to those used to prevent gang violence. NPR's Dina Temple-Raston could have been describing the best of American school practices in regard to gangs, violence, and bullying when recounting efforts in Minnesota and Denmark which pull families together to counter terrorist recruiters or reconnect young fighters with the community. 

An array of security experts enumerated the wide variety of threats that seem to be growing and changing rapidly, as well as the difficulties involved in a coordinated anti-terrorism campaign. The dangers are magnified by the growth of social media and the complexities of the digital world. But, the conferences also described our successes and reasons why the United States has been so effective in blocking a variety of attacks. For instance, while we are often frustrated by the complicated task of guarding our borders, U.S. immigration policy has been far more successful than European efforts in preventing attacks. As David Gersten of the Department of Homeland Security explains, the U.S. produces far fewer recruits for foreign civil wars because we do a better job at reaching out to the types of young people that terrorists would like to recruit. 

It is not just the government's ""enhanced engagement"" efforts that have undercut the recruitment of foreign fighters. America's response to mass migration from poor and/or unstable countries has obviously been imperfect, but we are still more welcoming to immigrants than most other nations are. Oklahoma City is like so many American communities that have become more prosperous and safer during the last twenty years as we became a magnet for immigrants. Our relative openness has been an eloquent answer to the international terrorists' narratives.

While the security experts' presentations confirm that the U.S. government, along with other state, international and local entities, has been very skillful in protecting our security, not every terrorist will be stopped. That is one reason why the resilience of our citizenry is all-important.  And, that is where public schools must join in. Schools deal with the legacies of trauma and segregation.  We could become great partners in ""winning the hearts and minds"" of not only potential terrorists but of a range of persons at risk for destructive behavior. 

Even if our democracy didn't face terrorist threats, our schools should borrow from the best practices described at the symposiums for proactive methods of diverting alienated young persons from the narratives that justify violence. We need full-service community schools that provide early education, medical, mental health, and other wraparound services. Our schools should be a venue where immigrant and nonimmigrant parents share conversations about the challenges of raising teens in the age of social networking. Our schools must become places where families are reminded that they belong, and that nurture trusting relationships. We must teach children how to rebound from adversity.

In the 21st century, our classrooms must be safe places for studying and conversing about multiculturalism. We must teach cultural literacy and digital ethics. Our students must be reminded of a key principle of our democracy. Political opponents are opponents, not enemies.

Twenty years after terrorism helped prompt teachers union, community, and business leaders to start down a path toward reconciliation and cooperation, President Clinton shared a secret at the Murrah Memorial. It turns out that he had known former Republican Governor Frank Keating longer than most Oklahomans had. Their partisan disagreements date back to college, lasting from 1965 to 1995.  But, they ended in April, 1995.

In an era of globalization, bigger and better fences won't fully protect our security. We must invest on the front end, before trauma, resentment, and isolation breed violence.  We need organic solutions that pull together the best of our diverse society. The lessons learned in the wake of terrorism must be heeded in advance of future threats. Or, to borrow from the Memorial Mission Statement, we must come to the Murrah Memorial ""to remember those who were killed, those who survived, and those changed forever."" May this memorial, may our schools and communities, and may our democratic heritage ""offer comfort, strength, peace, hope and serenity."" -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

My remarks concern the past, the present and the future.

The facts have been documented over a century of scholarship, eyewitness accounts, and testimony in trials carried out in Istanbul under Allied occupation after World War I. Sultan Abdul Hamid II launched bloody pogroms in late 19th century, resulting in deaths of 250,000 ethnic Armenians living on territories of the Ottoman Empire. Armenian community leaders were rounded up, killed, and deported on April 24, 1915. During the ensuing eight years, Armenians were systematically eliminated from their homeland. Up to 1.5 million died between 1915 and 1923. 

I am fed up by interminable discussions about whether the extermination of Armenians rises to the definition of genocide. Pope Francis recently called the slaughter of Armenians by Ottoman Turks ""the first genocide of the 20th century."" 

In turn, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ""condemned and warned"" Francis not to make ""such a mistake again."" Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu accused Francis of ""blackmail,"" saying the Pontiff had joined an ""evil front."" 

Erdogan wrote Armenia's President Robert Kocharian on April 10, 2005. He proposed a joint history commission to study archives and historical records. Erdogan expected the commission would refute the genocide and undermine efforts aimed at genocide recognition. The initiative was not a sincere effort aimed at illuminating the truth. I have never supported officially sponsored history commissions. They are usually disingenuous efforts, which open the door to assertions of ""shared suffering."" Moral equivalency is another instrument of denial.   

I have been involved in Turkish and Armenian issues since 1998. Then Turks were uncomfortable at the mere mention of Armenian issues. It was a code word for genocide recognition. 

Today things are different. Turks are no longer committed to categorical denial. Armenian issues are widely discussed by Turks. Hasan Cemal, the well-known journalist and grandson of Cemal Pasha, a Genocide era Turkish leader, wrote a book called The Armenian Genocide. Despite logistical obstacles, civil society initiatives engage Turks and Armenians on a broad range of issues. The European Parliament resolution of April 15 urges Ankara ""to recognize the Armenian Genocide and thus to pave the way for a genuine reconciliation between the Turkish and Armenian peoples.""

The Turkish-Armenian Reconciliation Commission (TARC), which I chaired from 2001 to 2004, was the first systematic effort to foster dialogue between Turks and Armenians. It was launched during the absence of official contact between Ankara and Yerevan. TARC helped break the ice and acted as a lightning road so other initiatives could proceed. 

TARC's final recommendations provided a way forward. TARC:

	 Suggested confidence building measures between Turks and Armenians.

	 Called on Turkey to end its embargo and open its border to Armenia. 

	 Recommended that the Turkish and Armenian governments issue statements in support of civil society programs in the fields of education, science, culture, trade, and tourism.

	 Proposed intensified government-to-government contacts leading to negotiations on normalization and opening the border for normal travel and trade. 

TARC also found a way to address the Genocide. It asked the International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ) to facilitate an independent legal analysis on the ""Applicability of the United nations Genocide Convention to Events which Occurred During the Early Twentieth century."" Based on the definition in the Genocide Convention (Article I, A-E), the finding concluded:

""International law generally prohibits the retroactive application of treaties...The Genocide Convention contains no provision mandating its retroactive application...Therefore, no legal, financial or territorial claim arising out of the Events could successfully be made against any individual or state under the Convention."" (This does not exclude claims under other rubrics of international or national law).  

The analysis continued: 

""The term genocide...may be applied, however, to many and various events that occurred prior to entry into force of the Convention."" Based on the definition of genocide, ""The core facts common to all the various accounts of the Events were met. At least some of the perpetrators knew that the consequence of their actions  would be the destruction in whole, or in part, of the Armenians of eastern Anatolia, as such, or acted purposefully towards this goal, and, therefore, possessed the requisite genocidal intent...The Events can thus be said to include all the elements of the crime of genocide as defined in the Convention, and legal scholars as well as historians, politicians, journalists and other people may be justified in continuing to so describe them."" 

I did not use the term genocide to characterize the events when TARC was launched. Based on the ICTJ facilitated analysis, I do use the term today. 

TARC was controversial. Some of TARC's initial discussions were confidential. Extremists on both sides were excluded. TARC was accused of being a pawn of the US Government; TARC members allegedly received compensation. 

For-the-record: The US supported TARC. So did five other governments. No payments were made to TARC members. I took all decisions regarding composition and agenda. Nobody in the State Department told me what to do; US officials knew better.  

TARC's findings and recommendations were endorsed by 53 Nobel Laureates. President George W. Bush twice commended TARC for its contribution in his Remembrance Day statements in 2004 and 2005.

Track two is not a substitute for official diplomacy. Swiss mediation picked up where TARC left off. Beginning in 2007, Swiss diplomats facilitated talks between Turkish and Armenian officials. Negotiations resulted in the Protocols on Establishment of Diplomatic Relations and Development of Bilateral Relations (10 October 2009). Prof. Dr. Michael Ambuhl, Switzerland's State Secretary for Foreign Affairs, played a pivotal role. 

The Protocols were a breakthrough. However, it became apparent that Ankara negotiated in bad faith. Erdogan linked ratification to resolution of issues in Nagorno-Karabakh (NK), though NK does not appear in text or annexes. He dismissed reports of de-linkage as ""slander and disinformation."" He went to Baku and assured his Azeri brothers that the Protocols would not be ratified as long as any Azeri territory was occupied by Armenians. With Erdogan undermining ratification, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton concluded: ""The ball is in Turkey's court.""

It is time to see Turkey for what it is, not how it used to be or how we wish it were. Under Erdogan, Turkey has become an authoritarian state. In 2012, environmental demonstrations in Taksim Square's Gezi Park sparked protests in 60 cities. Police brutality was widespread. Erdogan's government does not tolerate dissent. It uses Article 301 of the Penal Code and Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Act to limit freedom of expression. Political opponents are silenced, arrested under trumped up charges, and fired form their jobs. 

Beginning in 2012, Turks aided jihadi groups including ISIS through logistics, financing, weapons, and health services. Turkey has refused the multinational coalition fighting ISIS access to Incirlik Air Force Base near Turkey's border with Syria. 

NATO is more than a security alliance. It is a coalition of countries with shared values. Turkey's anti-Western and anti-democratic practices make it unsuitable as a NATO ally. If NATO were being formed today, Turkey would not qualify as a member. 


The Way Forward

Following are some steps that Turkish and Armenian civil society can take, and ways the international community can support their efforts:   

Open the border and, at a minimum, establish diplomatic relations.

Assist contact, communication and cooperation between Turks and Armenians by expanding the EU's support for people to-people projects. The State Department can also support such efforts by making an umbrella grant to an organization, which would fast-track grants to partners in the region. 

Renew discussion about the ICTJ-facilitated analysis on the applicability of the Genocide Convention. Both sides can find benefit from its findings. 

Foster alternative views within the AKP. Just two days ago, former President Abdullah Gul warned about the dangers of an executive presidency. Political pluralism in Turkey deserves support. 

Organize a reunion of Turkish and Armenian diplomats who negotiated the Protocols (after Turkey's national elections on June 7). Swiss Authorities could facilitate the informal meeting through their ambassadors in Ankara and Yerevan. 

Resist efforts to link ratification of the Protocols on progress in Nagorno-Karabakh. Turkey-Armenia relations are a bilateral issue. Azerbaijan under President Ilham Aliev is prone to conflict not conciliation.

Re-engage Hillary Clinton in Turkish-Armenian issues. She invested her personal prestige into the signing of the Protocols. Mrs. Clinton has a stake in the issue. 

Recognize the genocide. President Obama referred to the Genocide as ""Meds Yeghern"" or ""Great Calamity"" in the Armenian language. Obama says ""my personal views are well-known."" However, the President of the United States is not entitled to a personal opinion. He should say ""Genocide"" in this year's Presidential Statement on Remembrance Day. Doing so would catalyze greater discussion in Turkish society. It would put the United States on the right side of history. Genocide recognition is also a legacy issue for Barack Obama.   

I salute the heroic and visionary efforts of Turks and Armenians. Reconciliation is a lot like riding a bicycle. Stop pedaling and you fall over. 

Contact and cooperation can advance to the goal of rapprochement. Genocide recognition is also indispensable to reconciliation.

Thank you.

They are always being told to ""chill out"" and must deal with mounting stress because they try too hard. It is unrealistic to expect to control everything that happens to us in our day and the days to come, yet so many of us feel extreme anxiety over getting every detail just right and defining an outcome. 

Control is a reaction to fear. Fear of what will happen if we don't get the result we are pushing so hard for, while exhausting our selves and the people around us. The problem arises when we get caught up in over thinking, and focusing on what will go wrong without weighing what could go right. As Roosevelt so perfectly explained, ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.""

Here are five ways to getting more peace in our life no matter how much we need to be in control. These apply to the most mundane decisions we make as well as the major life changers.

1. Rethink 

Studies have shown that the stress response can be triggered by the ""perception"" of a threat, even when there is no reality of danger. If it is really all in our minds, then there is hope for the over controllers because a thought can be changed. 

Every thought we think is creating our future, and life will follow that thought to flow towards a positive or a negative experience. As Dr. Wayne Dyer likes to put it, ""Hostile people live in a hostile world, and loving people live in a loving world."" It is all in how we look at it, so the choice is ours. If we want to be optimistic and live in a happy, friendly world, we must stop controlling and micro-managing every minute detail.

Next time we feel that we are losing control of a situation because fighting to change the outer circumstances isn't working, we can choose to experience the same situation, only... differently. Observing it from another perspective is something we can control. Instead of blaming something or someone outside of us, we can think about how to put the situation in a more positive light. 

When we change the way we look at things, the things themselves can begin to change too. We can choose to shift our reality from worry and fear to peace and love. William Blake, 18th century mystical poet, wrote: ""If the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is, infinite""

2. Be Flexible

Change is good and necessary for spiritual growth. Author Napoleon Hill wrote, ""Through the law of change, man is forced to keep on growing."" He believed that we must have flexible personalities in order to grow. Next time someone offers to go to a restaurant we previously refused to go to, or offers to drive instead, or picks the movie for the night, we need to just go with it and relax to prove that the outcome will work out for the best without our constant input.

3. Be Grateful

An attitude of gratitude slows down the impulse to alter and control a situation. Studies of participants keeping a gratitude journal report an increase in alertness, enthusiasm, energy, and goal attainment. They felt better about their lives as a whole and were more optimistic about the coming week. Even without a journal, just recalling one different reason a day we can be grateful for, will make us less fearful of the future, making it easier to relinquish control.

4. Let Go

Deepak Chopra's sixth spiritual law of success is the Law of Detachment. He advises us to let go of rigid ideas on how things ""should be"" and remain open for new opportunities. Otherwise, we are just limiting our own future. How do we really know what is going to be best out of all the amazing possibilities the world has to offer? We need to get out of our own way. Let go and open our selves to the natural flow of the universe. 

5. Meditate

Meditation is not only a method of stress relief, but also the great shifter of perception.  The Dalai Lama suggests:

Through training our minds, with constant effort, we can change our mental perceptions or mental attitudes. This can make a real difference in our lives. If we have a positive mental attitude, then even when surrounded by hostility, we shall not lack inner peace.

Meditation can literally alter our brains and therefore our state of awareness for the better. Meditation can calm our emotions and bring the endless churning of thoughts to rest, so we can discover that peace is always there, waiting inside of us. Meditation opens us up to an unobstructed and realistic view of the world without the ego triggers. 

There are different meditation methods that all lead to the same place of peace. Recovering control freaks love meditation since there is very little to control. It can be done under any circumstances and fits into any routine. There are even mobile apps for the phone available with guided meditation, mindfulness and relaxation music, to allow us the convenience to go within anytime we need it.

Relax, peace is possible, even for control freaks. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

In the midst of news coverage regarding the shooting of Walter Scott, many people are terrified by the daily killings of black and brown youth in America. The phrase ""Black Lives Matter"" is being intellectualized as physical life, while the spirit of the black community is also under attack. Black spirituality in America manifests itself in various ways. The black church, the mosque, traditional African practices and other religions aid African Americans in coping with being treated like second-class citizens. The Black conversion to Christianity and Islam in America was due to its influential language of freedom and its stance on social justice. Wherever there is faith, spirituality and religion you will specifically find black people there. 

Yet, many of these religions, especially Christianity, have been told through a white perspective. A man who calls himself ""Mr. Savannah Black,"" created the highly-criticized #BurnWhiteJesus movement. Mr. Black's mission is not to disrespect Christ's image but to resist white supremacy. He is attempting to point out an issue which the photo below questions.



In other words, the world knows Jesus was not white, but the image of ""White Jesus"" has been used to alienate people of color from feeling empowered. God made man in his own image and Jesus represents God on Earth, so when Jesus is depicted as white in movies, books, statues and in art people believed this to be historically true. ""From birth, there's an attempt to prove to us that we are ugly, worthless, inferior and less than... This is a violent assault on the mind,"" said Tufts University undergraduate, Chi-Chi Osuagwu. 

It is senseless to confine Jesus to an ethnicity or race, since he came for the salvation of the whole world. The Western world, however, continually illustrates Jesus as a white man, which is a gross display of ignorance or another scheme at hegemonic imposition of its racial superiority. Hence, the problem of racial marginalization that black people feel in this aspect of spirituality is a result of countless years of dehumanization, psychological barraging and cultural rape.

Sadly these atrocious acts seem to have become a norm of the White American culture as Black spirituality has not only been tampered with through false images but through cultural smudging of Afro-Indigenous spiritual practices. Kendra Rosalie Lara Paredes, the co-founder and executive director of Beantown Society, commented on the sale of a ""Local Branch Smudge Kit"" by Urban Outfitters. ""This is disrespectful,"" said Paredes, ""[my] ancestors angry as all hell."" Paredes commented further, 

It was a smudging kit with sage and turkey feathers and a ceramic ash dish. [It is] spiritual cleansing stuff. But for like 40 bucks when sage is like $8. They're appropriating our spiritual practices and making them expensive and trendy, like yoga.

The page for the smudge kit sale has recently been taken down. 

Liturgical dance, for example, is criticized by many in the Catholic Church because the bodily movement is categorized as sexual. However, African Americans do not see it as a means of fleshly pleasure but the use of the body to not only resist oppression, but to communicate with the Creator. Remember, God cursed that which condemned King David for dancing too hard, so whose place is it to say dancing in the church incites eroticism? The bottom line remains that this is an issue of doctrine, and people should respect how any group wishes to serve God. It is deeply rooted in the African culture to express passion and spirituality with dance and as Alice Walker affirmed, ""Hard times require furious dancing."" Bodily movement strives against oppression and ultimately heals the soul. From the slave ship to the streets of every urban city, black people have created ways to express themselves in a society that still does not consider them as fully human.

The creative and resistant force of the African American soul, according to Dr. Carlyle Fielding Stewart III, is the ultimate reference point for black existence. When anything resists or serves as an obstacle to the black soul, it threatens the existence of black people. Fortunately, black people in America have exhibited great strength and continue to do so through unity, organization, resistance, cooperative economics and ""the knowledge of self.""

OSHUN NYC and Their Mission:

Black activists vigorously advocate for young black men and women in their respective communities and nationwide. Yet, black artists use their craft in creative ways to heal the soul. Thandiwe and Niambi Sala, the hip hop duo of OSHUN NYC, are making it their mission to spread peace, empower all people and instill cultural pride, which is no simple task. OSHUN, which started in a college dorm room in New York, is touching thousands of young lives primarily those of African descent. Their influence by the Yoruba religious tradition, one of the 10 largest religions in the world, guides their musical talent and empowers their ideas. 


OSHUN performed at The Red Bull Sound Select presents: New York 

Thandi, whose father is an expert of African theology, grew up in a Christian family but adopted the Yoruba tradition. It is common among African Americans to believe in an Abrahamic religion while practicing various African traditions. Niambi grew up in a pan-African community in D.C. She was blessed with self-knowledge and has been performing from a very young age. Niambi is the daughter of an educator and musician in the D.C. area. Thandi and Niambi attend yearly festivals that are hosted by Pan-African organizations like Ankobea which promote healing, rite of passage ceremonies, and ancient African history (prior to chattel slavery in America). 


OSHUN NYC Mixtape ""ASASE YAA"" releases on April 22, Earth Day

OSHUN NYC exemplifies the word ""Sankofa,"" meaning to go back and retrieve. The duo has gone back to their cultural roots with their Afrocentric regalia and is inspiring others to do the same.The end of beautiful practices such as this is a crime against nature, life, and the beauty of cultural diversity in the world. Thandi and Niambi have proudly exalted their roots while firmly evolving in their milieu as torch bearers for this aspect of blackness; they have held on so that their blackness will not be robbed.

As a parent educator, I spend a lot of time thinking about how adults treat children. I preach about kindness and connection. I go on and on about how we have to model the behavior we want to see and practice the self-regulation of our emotions. And here is where I've caught myself behaving badly. 

I often implore my son; ""Please, practice patience,"" when waiting is necessary from him. Then I snap, ""I'm losing my patience!"" whenever he makes me wait. 

I want him to move from playtime to mealtime to bedtime with ease (and on my timetable), while I tell him, ""Wait a minute,"" or ""Hang on while I finish this email."" 

I say, ""Would you just listen to me?"" and ""You're not paying attention!"" 

But as it turns out, I am the one who is not paying attention.



Right, I forgot. 

One reason I forgot is that, like you, I do too much. Whether or not we work outside the home (in our own backyard, on a playground, or at the office), we are all busting our humps. Self-aware parenting is tough, no matter where you spend your days. 

Also, small, developing people really are inconvenient. 

You know that skittish, trapped feeling you get when your children are uncooperative and you're running late? That's certainly worthy of our attention. Recognizing our emotional state requires that we tune in and notice. 

I will be doing more of that: Paying attention. Noticing.

I'll pay attention when  I feel burnt out and need a break. 

I'll notice the rising elevator of panic in my belly when my 6-year-old pedals his wobbling bike faster and faster. Even though he is totally fine,  I will admit that parenting is just plain scary at times. 

I will pay attention to the way he looks up at me and says, ""I want to hold your hand,""  as he steps out of the car. (He has actually listened to what I have so often requested!)

You will pay attention when your daughter falls apart after losing Go Fish. This means that she is too young to be a ""good loser."" You'll skip the lecture and get her laughing as you make a heartfelt promise to lose every other game for the rest of your life.

We can observe when our children ask for every toy in the store. We'll offer the warm, firm limit that it's not a toy-buying day, and acknowledge that this is difficult. Wanting and not getting is hard -- even for those of us with mature, adult brains. 

These all-too-human lessons will be learned in good time, and will be best incorporated as we stay connected and loving -- with ourselves, and our little ones. Both our emotional state and our children's disruptive behavior are saying: ""Please, pay attention.""  

We are not managing inconveniences; we are raising human beings. 

Remember in as many moments as you can.

Alex Boone, an offensive lineman who played under Harbaugh when he coached the San Francisco 49ers, said the hard-driving coach may be certifiably ""crazy,"" NBC Sports' ProFootballTalk reported Sunday. 

""I think he just pushed guys too far,"" he told HBO's ""Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel"" in a segment to air Tuesday, as quoted by NBC's ProFootballTalk. 

""He wanted too much, demanded too much, expected too much. You know, 'We gotta go out and do this. We gotta go out and do this. We gotta go out and do this.' And you'd be like, 'This guy might be clinically insane. He's crazy,'"" said Boone, who does not hold a degree in psychology. 

In a reported ""mutual"" parting of the ways, Harbaugh left the 49ers in December and signed a deal to coach his alma mater, Michigan, where he played quarterback before playing in the NFL. (Harbaugh's father, Jack Harbaugh, also served as an assistant football coach for the Wolverines in the 1970s.)

According to an SFGate 49ers' blog, Boone's statements were a departure from September, when he said, ""I know for a fact everyone loves Harbaugh.""

To be fair, Boone also said on ""Real Sports"" that Harbaugh will make a better college coach than an NFL coach.

Echoing Boone, Mike Greenberg said Harbaugh is a college coach and is ""right where he belongs,"" while taking about the report on ESPN's ""Mike & Mike"" on Monday. Greenberg effusively praised Harbaugh as well, saying he ""is as good a football coach as there is"" and ""might be the best football coach in the world.

Harbaugh on ""Real Sports"" himself, acknowledged the alleged difficulties of him getting along with others, saying, ""it must be true, yeah, sometimes I wear out my welcome,"" per ProFootballTalk.

Here's a preview of the Harbaugh segment on ""Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel"":

While some people take the opportunity to share about their latest meal, other people post photos or inspirational messages. Over the past few years, researchers have discovered the way people choose to present themselves on Facebook speaks volumes about their personality and self-esteem.

Examining your behavior on social media could give you insight into your own personality, as well as how others perceive you. You may think you're presenting yourself in a certain light only to discover other people view your behavior completely different.

Here are seven things our Facebook interactions reveal about people:

1. People with a lot of Facebook friends tend to have low self-esteem. A 2012 study  published in Computers in Human Behavior found that people with low self-esteem who worried about their public perception had the most Facebook friends. The researchers concluded that self-conscious people compensate for low self-esteem by trying to appear popular on Facebook.

2. Extroverts update their status more often than introverts. Just like in real life, extroverts socialize more on social media, according to a 2014 study titled ""Personality Traits and Self-Presentation at Facebook ."" The study found that extroverts use the like button more often, upload more pictures, and update their status more frequently than introverts.

3. Conscientious people organize their photos carefully. Conscientious people are self-disciplined hard-workers who spend the least amount of time on Facebook. A 2014 study published in Computers in Human Behavior, reports that when conscientious people do use Facebook, they do so in a very organized manner.  For example, they may create neat folders to help share their photos with friends and family in a methodical and convenient way.

4. Open people fill out their personal profiles most thoroughly. A 2010 study called, ""Social Network Use and Personality,"" discovered that open people--described as artistic, imaginative, and creative--use the most features on Facebook and are most likely to complete the personal information sections. They also tend to post more ""wall messages"" when communicating with specific friends.

5. Narcissists make deeper self-disclosures that contain self-promotional content. Narcissists--people with an inflated self-concept and a strong sense of uniqueness and superiority--seek attention and affirmation on Facebook. A 2014 study published in Computers in Human Behavior found that narcissists posted more frequently about themselves in an attempt to attract likes and comments that fuel their beliefs about self-importance. Other studies have found that narcissistic people love to post selfies and they share the ones where they think they look most attractive in hopes of gaining admiration.

6. Neurotic people post mostly photos. A 2014 study titled, ""Capturing Personality from Facebook Photos and Photo-Related Activity,"" found that highly neurotic people -- those most prone to stress and anxiety -- seek acceptance by publishing photos. Since neurotic people struggle with communication and social skills, researchers believe they use photos on Facebook as a means to express themselves. Also, photos are less controversial than comments -- which could lead to a lot of anxiety as they wait for other people's responses.

Neurotic people tend to have the most photos per album. Researchers believe this stems from their desire to present themselves positively. They may use photos to try and appear happier and to show they are able to keep up with their friends. Over time, however, the behavior of highly neurotic people tends to change. They're likely to imitate their friends' Facebook behavior in an attempt to seek acceptance and decrease feelings of loneliness.

7. Agreeable people are tagged in other people's photos most often. A 2012 study titled, ""Personality and Patterns of Facebook Usage,"" found that the higher a person ranks in personality scales for agreeableness, the more likely that person will be tagged in Facebook photos posted by other people. Since agreeable people tend to behave warm and friendly and less competitive, it's not surprising that their friends enjoy taking lighthearted pictures with them and sharing them on Facebook.

Although we may think we're masking our insecurities or portraying ourselves in the most favorable light, our behavior on social media reveals more than we might think. It's not just what we post on Facebook that reveals information about our personalities -- it's also what we don't post that can be quite telling. It's likely that our personality profiles will continue to play a major role in how advertisers market to us and how companies will choose to hire people in the future.

You'll note that Carm seems a jovial enough fellow, Miles a bit of a curmudgeon; Carm a free spirit, Miles clearly academic.  Which seems to be how they work, not so much in collaboration as in friendly (?) contention with each other.  They make their appearance at art openings and receptions--these are sometimes called ""performances""--but, despite promises for public debate, never both at the same time.

Carm seems the more active and creative of the pair, Miles more the critic.  Carm specializes in the design and creation of covers for found books, which are the objects on display on the walls at Future Studio, the offbeat gallery in Highland Park where Stuart Rapeport and Amy Inouye hold court with a pair of rather oddly assorted dogs and a plethora of also oddly assorted collectibles.  (Disclosure: Amy, a book designer by craft, designed my own two most recent books.)  Their current show is ""Thirty-Nine Books, Part II.""  Was there a Part I?  I don't know.  It's possible.  Is there a sly reference in the title to John Buchan's ""Thirty-Nine Steps""? I don't know, but given the bibliophile bent of Goode/Forthwrighte, that too is possible.

For Goode, books are clearly a source of creative joy.  He plays with the relationship between the content of old volumes--picked up, I can only imagine, in some esoteric bookstore--and the covers he creates.  Of particular appeal to The Buddha Diaries, for example, is ""Buddhabux: The Currency of Spiritual Wealth""--a spoof not only on the spread of popular ""spiritual"" fads but also on the power of money in today's political and social culture.  The front cover offers the display of two elaborately-designed Buddhabux banknotes, while the back cover blurb (as is the case with all Goode's covers), is an elegantly-written satirical passage about the relationship between said spirituality and cold hard cash.  

And... ""How To Change Your Mind"" is a spoof on pop psychology, specifically the Gestalt variety that blossomed in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  ""The Seven Lost Muses"" lists the inspirational (but hitherto neglected) Inne-Briana, Errora, Mortislina and others...  Philosophical and psychological studies blend the serious with the hilariously absurd.  Fiction blends cheerfully with fact, and actual ""literature"" with pure invention--and we never know quite where we stand between the two.  The ground shifts constantly.  And Miles is sure to poke his nose in here and there with a wry, acerbic comment on Carm's work, or a book of his own (""The Third Person, In the Shadow Of...""--presumably Carm Goode).

As always, satire has a serious purpose.  We are asked to consider the injustices of our society, the absurdity of a good deal of popular belief, the pretensions of science and religion.  What's astonishing is the encyclopedic nature of Goode's reach.  His ""Official Catalogue of The Aperion  (look it up!) Bibilotheque"" is a ""Library of Actual, Theoretical, and Partial Books (...) devoted to exploring the prior conditions for understanding The Human Condition.""  It's the product of a rich and infinitely curious imagination, as is the collection of samples offered on the Future Studio shelves.  Go see for yourself.  You might even change your mind.  though I'm not sure about what. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

This week, local officials in the Florida Keys will decide whether to approve the first ever release of genetically engineered (GM) mosquitoes in the United States. Yes, you read that right: lab-engineered mosquitoes could be released in one of America's favorite tourist destinations very soon, even though it's unclear if any government agency has evaluated the full array of health and environmental risks associated with these new GM insects.

Unfortunately, the Florida Keys Tourist Development Council (TDC) and the Monroe County Board of Commissioners have been conspicuously absent from the conversation about GM mosquitoes even though this experiment could have a direct impact on business in the Keys. The proposal to release millions of these mosquitoes by British company Oxitec is instead being vetted by a small, local board called the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District. This mosquito district has touted GM mosquitoes as a potential boon to tourism in the Keys because they could reduce dengue fever, though the Keys haven't had a case in a half-decade.

Of course, Florida's mosquito problem should not be trivialized. Dengue fever is a leading cause of illness and death for those in tropical and subtropical climates, according to the Centers for Disease Control. But Oxitec has not provided evidence to support that its mosquitoes will be able to effectively control dengue. On the contrary, reports from the field suggest the opposite. Malaysia's Health Minister recently announced that after field-testing Oxitec's mosquitos, the country will not be pursuing the program because it was not cost-effective. Additionally, one Brazilian town was still at the highest alert for dengue fever even after Oxitec's mosquitoes were released there in 2013.

Even if these bugs did successfully wipe out the entire population of the targeted A. aegypti mosquito, the Asian tiger mosquito (also a known vector of dengue and other diseases) could easily take its place. Letting tiger mosquitoes become more commonplace would only make a new dengue fever carrier more prevalent.

Oxitec claims that its mosquitoes are engineered with a lethal gene that is supposed to break the pest's reproductive cycle because its offspring, for the most part, die before reaching adulthood. The company claims this would theoretically reduce the mosquito population and the prevalence of dengue fever without the need for pesticides. But the Mosquito Control District has not done enough to identify insecticide alternatives. Instead of exploring a range of options, they have hastily and aggressively pursued Oxitec's GM mosquito program despite strong public opposition and a lack of peer-reviewed data.

Significant public opposition defeated Oxitec's first plan to release GM mosquitoes in Key West in 2012, but Oxitec is now poised to win approval in Key Haven, a peninsula just a few miles east of Key West. Hundreds of thousands of citizens from across the country have written local, state and federal officials to oppose this plan and last week, hundreds of people called the local tourism council to ask that the Keys be preserved as a national treasure for tourists and residents alike, not for GM mosquito experiments.  

It is puzzling that any local official would sit on the sidelines while GM mosquitoes were allowed to potentially tarnish the reputation that most Americans have of the Florida Keys as a pristine island paradise. But that is exactly what the Florida Keys Tourist Development Council and the Monroe County Board of County Commissioners have been doing.

It's high time that local officials took decisive steps to stop this bizarre plan now instead of inheriting the more difficult task of attracting visitors to a place where residents and tourists are the subjects of a science experiment. It's clear now that GM mosquitoes could not only potentially harm public health and the environment -- they may also be bad for business.

Despite what many Republicans claim, we are the richest country humanity has ever seen and we are at our richest moment.  Yet, hardworking Americans keep coming home to ""a plate full of worry"". This is largely because over the last few decades the wages of the bottom 80% of Americans has fallen or stagnated, while the super-rich rake in all the profits. We can do better and we must. Please see the full text of my speech below. 

I was born and raised in Rogers Park in Chicago.  My father sold furniture and my mother was a Chicago Public School teacher and proud member of the Chicago Teachers Union for decades.  My first seven years were in an apartment, and then my parents were able to buy a small 3 bedroom house in West Rogers Park right near Rogers School and a short bus ride away from Sullivan High School.  We were far from rich, but I never remember my parents worrying about money.  

In retirement, they were able to travel, thanks in large part to my mother's teacher pension, which also assured my dad's income after she died.

Every Sunday we would drive down Western Ave to visit my Grandparents in Humbolt Park.  A couple of weeks ago, I drove past 2606 W. Walton to see their house and more importantly, the garage, which was my favorite place because it was the barn at the time, the home of Teddy the horse.  Every morning before dawn, Teddy would pull my grandfather's wagon to the central market to pick up the heavy bags of potatoes and other vegetables that my Grandpa would sell up and down the alleys of the neighborhood, schlepping those bags up and down the back stairs.  All four of his children went to college:  one lawyer, two teachers, one businesswoman.

On Sundays, the grown-ups would be in the kitchen, gossiping in Yiddish.  My grandparents and parents were born in Russia, except my mother who was born in the New World - Canada - before they made their way, with the help of the Salvation Army to America.  A typical immigrant story; a typical Chicago story.

All of their children did better than they did, as was expected by just about everyone.  In our case, we had a cottage in Michigan City, built in part by my dad's own hand and shared with my Aunt and Uncle.  Even the men that worked a union job in the South Side steelmills in the 50s and 60s could afford a cabin where his wife and kids could go for the summer.  Most of those are now torn down as the Indiana/Michigan lakeshore becomes more tony, and for the wealthier.

We were not rich, but neither were we worried.  How different from today, when MOST families come home every night, as Richard Trumka, Pres of the AFL-CIO put it, ""to a full plate of worry."" 

Elizabeth Warren tells about her childhood when her family of 3 could make it on the minimum wage.  That wage has not gone up in real buying power since 1966.

But I'm not here just to reminisce about the good old days.  Many may describe my childhood as SO 20th Century.  SO yesterday.  SO gone and gone forever.  But I want to tell a different story, with a happy ending:  that economic security for everyday Americans not only is possible, but unless we achieve it, all of us are in deep trouble. 

Here's the most important data point.  The United States of America has never been richer.  We are the richest country humanity has ever seen and its richest moment.  

Between 1979 and 2014, the per capita Gross Domestic Product grew 77% and productivity rose 75%.  But over the last decades, the wages of the bottom 80% of Americans has fallen or stagnated.  Just since the Great Recession of 2008, the richest 1% of Americans has seen 95% of the benefits from this growth.  According to Larry Summers, former Treasury Sec, if the US had the same income distribution it had in 1979, that bottom 89% would have $1 trillion more in income -- $11,000 per family.  

8 Americans made at least $10 billion each in 2013. $10 billion is as much as almost 200,000 Americans earn in a year combined.  The vast majority of those 8 fortunes were realized not as a result of work, but the old fashioned way - inheritances, stock market and other investments.  The best way to earn a fortune in America, is to already have one.  

And speaking of inheritance, last Thursday the Republican majority house voted to eliminate the estate tax altogether.  Understand that you can already pass on to your children $5.4 million or $10.8 million as a couple.  But now they wanted to do more for 5,500 estates by scrapping any tax.  Doing that will cost the treasury $259 billion over 10 years.  Remember, this is money passed on to the likes of Paris Hilton and her bratty brother who did not work even one single hour to earn it.  And this tax cut is part of a $1Trillion tax cut, almost all for the wealthiest, over 10 years, unpaid for, adding to the debt.

And while we are told we can't increase nutrition spending for the 1 in 5 American children who are ""food insecure"" without cutting something else to pay for it - otherwise would be irresponsible of course, leaving our children with a huge debt burden - and yet ending the estate tax is unpaid for, all adding to the deficit and debt.  

But what am I saying?  We didn't increase child nutrition at all, even paid for.  No, the Republican-passed budget cuts the SNAP (food stamps) by $125 billion.  I asked them, ""Did you really come to Congress to take food out of the mouths of hungry children.  Who are you?""  So it's part of their plan to make hundreds of thousands of American children, our Chicago children, go hungry in order to help the Walton kids.  That's just a fact.

26 profitable Fortune 500 companies paid  no taxes from 2008 to 2013,  Verizon and GE among them and they got refunds that I promise is much bigger than any of yours -- $2.9 Billion for GE, an effective tax rate of -9%, only $732 million refund for Verizon on $42 billion in US profits.

Apple - the nation's most profitable tech company, (we love our Apple everything) dodged taxes on an estimated $74 billion in earnings over a 4 year period through foreign tax shelters and loopholes. 

I could go on - so I will for a minute more.  Governor Bruce Rauner reduced his Illinois tax liability by $750,000 when the rate went from 5% to 3.5%.   Now he wants to cut Medicaid by $1.4 billion and eliminate adult dental and foot care, breast and cervical cancer programs, 30% for higher education and way more.  That's what you do with a turnaround company.  Bottom line matters; people don't.

Americans can't afford to retire.  The National Institute on Retirement Security put out a chilling report recently: 4 out of 5 household have less than one year's income in retirement savings.  In fact, the average working-age household has only $2500 in retirement assets while average near-retirement households have a whopping $12,000. 

So in this richest country in the world at its richest moment, government operates in a framework of scarcity - when it comes to investments that help regular people.  We're going broke, or we are broke.  We can't even agree on a long-term transportation bill to fund our roads and bridges and mass transit and all the jobs they create, much less fix the huge number of schools in desperate need of repair.

In Washington, both the House and Senate Republican-passed budgets that cut investments in heath care, education, housing, and other domestic priorities by almost 40% -- the lowest level seen in the last 50 years.

Problem is, this is really bad.  Even if you don't care about regular people, it's really bad for our economy.

Working families spend about 90% of their income on consumption - buying stuff.  The rich spend less than 45%.  In 2012 alone, an estimated $1.3 trillion was sucked out of our economy because it sat in bank accounts of the richest Americans instead of being spent.  If that money went to people who would spend it, it is estimated that it would create 10 million jobs.

I'm trying to stick to economics and not morality - what's good for the American economy and not about right and wrong.  

But I can't.  Here's what Congressman Tom Price, Chairman of the Budget Committee said in justifying a budget that makes the worst income inequality since 1929 considerably worse:

""Many of our friends here on this floor have asked about budgets being moral documents, and they are.  Let me ask, Madam Chair: Where is the morality in trapping disadvantaged people in a web of welfare programs that discourage self-sufficiency and, instead, shackle them to government dependency?  Where is the morality, Madam Chair, in committing retirees to a health coverage program that is going bankrupt and that can't keep its promises if its so-called protectors keep blocking reform?  Where is the morality, Madam Chair, in forcing low-income people into second rate health programs in which many can't get appointments and in which doctors are grossly under-reimbursed by the government? Where is the morality, Madam Chair, in tying college students to years of crippling debt because of a government-run loan program that drives up tuition? Where is the morality in heaping trillions of dollars of debt onto future generations to finance today's government spending because today's policymakers refuse to stop overspending?

If you agree with this definition of morality, you haven't been spending much time reading the scriptures of any religion.  You also don't understand the facts about the success of Medicare and Medicaid or who really contributes to college debt by cutting Pell Grants, and how many people who need government help go to work every day for poverty wages. When pious words like ""shared sacrifice"", making ""tough decisions"", or ""reform"" are used, regular people better hang on to their wallets.  

OK. Now comes the good news part of my speech.  There are solutions to all these problems.  We can ask people who have more than they or their children or grandchildren can ever spend, to pay a bit more to the common good, money that won't dent their life-styles, money that will hardly be missed.  I just happen to have bills that will do that including H.R. 389, the Fairness in Taxation Act.  Right now there are 7 tax brackets up to $413,201 in taxable income, 39.6% for the top bracket whether you make $413,000 or $413 million.  So my bill says, let's update the code and create 5 more brackets but still keep the rate under what it was during most of Reagan's administration - 50%.  (It was 92% during Eisenhower.)  So for $1 million taxable income the rate is 45% and ratchets up to 49% for $1 billion in income.  Capital gains and dividends would be taxed at those same rates.  That raises a cool $800 billion over the next decade.  I have support from millionaires, by the way.  More than you think.

Senator Bernie Sanders and I introduced H.R. 1790, the Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act, to stop profitable corporations from sheltering income in places like the Cayman Islands and other tax havens, and end tax breaks for companies that encourage them to ship jobs overseas.  Profits would be taxed wherever they are earned by American companies.  This bill would raise half a trillion dollars in additional revenue.

I'm full of good ideas like these.  Social Security would be solvent into the next century if we just lifted the cap on income for which one has to pay into the trust fund.  Instead of stopping payment at $113,000, people like Bruce Rauner who make that much in less than 5 hours (he makes about $25,000 and hour) would have to pay FICA again, say after his income exceeds $200 or $250,000.  We would have enough not only to protect Social Security, but to expand and strengthen it.  Retirees are increasingly depending on all or nearly all of their retirement income coming from Social Security.  The average earned benefit check is $1,300 per month - less for women.  The Tribune editorialized against even the talk of improving Social Security, chastising Elizabeth Warren by name.  We are celebrating Social Security's 80th birthday this year and celebrating that SS never missed a check.  Sorry Tribune, Americans of all stripes support Social Security and will work to make it even better.

Senator Durbin and I will be reintroducing a bill that rewards American companies that are paying good wages and benefits to their workers here at home.  It's called ""The Patriotic Employer Tax Credit Act"" and provides a $1200 per U.S. employee tax credit for companies that meet those benchmarks and grow or maintain their U.S. workforce.  How can we afford it?  By closing those corporate tax loopholes.

Those are the kind of ""reforms"" and ""hard choices"" and ""shared sacrifice"" that make sense to me.  

But here's the best news of all, and the reason that I keep smiling even though it's pretty miserable in Washington these days and people are always asking me ""How can you stand it.""  My answer is that, despite the way things appear right now, we are actually in a progressive, populist moment.  Here's my evidence:

•	More than 80% of Americans believe we should raise revenue for needed investments by closing corporate loopholes and outsourcing incentives and limiting deductions for the wealthy.
•	More than 60% of voters want to end the lower tax rate in for capital gains and dividends so that actual work is not taxed at a higher rate than investments.  
•	More than 80% of Americans want us to increase taxes on the profits that American corporations make overseas.
•	Almost 70% of voters believe that we should end tax breaks to large corporations that ship jobs overseas - and use that money to invest in jobs in America.  

Also, much to the surprise of some of my colleagues, there are important things happening outside of Congress.   I have participated in the Fight for 15, minimum wage workers striking for $15 an hour and the right to have a union.  I have been out on the street several times in Chicago, and also in Washington and New York.  Bruce Rauner's obsessive fight against organized labor is actually helping to create a backlash.  Good union jobs that afforded those South Side steelworkers a decent middle class life and a secure retirement don't have to be relics of the last century.  If farmworkers could organize, so can home care workers and nursing home workers, and fast food workers.  Si se puede -- not just a slogan.

Immigrants have inspired a new fighting spirit.  A huge coalition, including most of the business community, supports comprehensive immigration reform.  It will happen.  Certain things have the stamp of inevitability about them, and immigration is at the top of that list - along with marriage equality.  Every generation of Americans and Chicagoans especially, has been revitalized and enriched by a new wave of immigration.  It will happen.

I'm feeling really optimistic about the 2016 elections.  I think that many Americans who are struggling are tired of being used as cannon fodder by the richest and most self-interested gazillionaires and corporate interests.  The problem, as Hillary Clinton puts it, that ""the deck is stacked against them"", is gaining traction every day.  

The answer to ""Why is this woman smiling?"" is simple.  Change is on its way, and not a minute too soon for this great country of ours. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

""The youth don't vote because they think politicians don't care. Politicians don't care because the youth don't vote."" These words still ring true in my ears when I advocate for youth empowerment and talk with my fellow constituents about becoming more civically engaged.

According to the most recent poll released by The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE), the youth turnout rate for the 2014 midterm elections was 21.5 percent, which is comparable to that of previous midterm elections. This marks a continuous decrease in youth turnout, which can potentially result in a very dangerous turn for our democracy. 

The rapid decline in the youth voter turnout data raises a terrifying concern: who is going to speak for us when the adults are gone? The continuous widening gap between the elderly and youth vote reveals the alarming realization that one day, there may no longer be a voter population to uphold democracy. 

Many of the youth are constantly being undermined and discouraged by the social culture that we have in our day and age. Although we live in the social media age of Facebook, Tumblr, and Twitter, it has become very difficult to promote positive political discussions without the fear of self-alienation. Furthermore, we are seen as the most apathetic generation, and yet there is almost nothing that politicians are doing to encourage the one of the most important, if not, the most important demographic to vote. 

Why is it important for the youth to vote? Well, there are student loans, employment rates, the national debt, reproductive rights, LGBT rights -- just to name a few issues that are extremely important to the youth. Aside from being the future of the country's voter make-up, the youth have a lot at stake when it comes to selecting their representatives for the national legislature. By 2015, Millennials will make up one-third of the electorate. We need to pay more attention to the issues that candidates address in their platforms, and candidates need to start addressing our concerns. Little do we know, we have a lot to be concerned about. 

Currently, nearly 71 percent of the U.S. population lives in a state where same-sex marriage is legal and openly LGBT persons are allowed to serve in the military. However, there are more strides to be made in terms of making sure that 71 percent increases to 100 percent. Although not every youth is unified behind the LGBT equality movement, this issue, like many others, stands to be very popular amongst the youth. 

Nonetheless, there is nothing that has been more glaring than the rapidly increasing hike in tuition prices for higher education in this country. Over the years, college tuition have increased more rapidly than the rate of inflation -- that's terrifying. According to a report published by College Board, tuition and fees at private colleges have increased to 3.7 percent on average to $31, 231 this academic year. In-state residents at four-year public schools, the tuition and fees have risen by 2.9 percent to $9,139. Whereas, inflation has risen by 1.4 percent in the year up until September 2014. According to The Institute for College Access & Success, an Oakland, California-based advocacy group, about 69 percent of college seniors graduate with student debt.
This further reinforces the growing concern that higher education has become increasingly unaffordable, had puts many youth in a disadvantaged position.

On another note, reproductive rights have been a hot topic in the past year in Washington. With a Republican-controlled Congress, the Republicans are making it a priority to pass anti-abortion legislation -- if you care about this at all, this is your time to raise your voice. 

In addition, according to a recent report released by the U.S. Department of Defense, the youth (25 years of age or younger) make-up almost half of the U.S. Military, which further reinforces the idea that the youth do have a lot at stake at the ballot box, more than people would like to think.

These issues are just several of many that need to be included in the conversation for the upcoming elections, especially 2016. Are we doing anything about these issues? Yes. Representative Sara Blair, the 18-year old, took the West Virginia state legislature election by storm. She, along with many other youths in our country, are making great strides to make a positive impact in our communities. Alex Wirth, founder and former Chair of the Campaign for a Presidential Youth Council, is working to establish an organization that promotes the discussion between our country's policymakers and our youth. 

There have been long strides made in the past decade in the aforementioned areas, and there are more strides to be made by policymakers and the youth alike. However, Washington can no longer overshadow the youth voice with its constant bickering and gridlock partisanship. The youth are ready to work to make progress to improve our country's antiquated laws, but the politicians and society as a whole need to start empowering the youth voice. The voters that we need to include the most are the youth, the ones that are already championing for these issues but have long been neglected. In order for this country to progress in every aspect, one-third of the electorate needs to be welcomed into the conversation. 

People are starting to forget that this is a collaborative effort. In order to continue to preserve democracy, we need to make sure that we are encouraging the youth to become more civically engaged by providing more opportunities for them to do so. In addition, we need to place more emphasis on the importance of the youth vote and participation in our classrooms and society. Politicians, community leaders, teachers, and parents: I am inviting you to start supporting the youth in your communities by demonstrating the significance of the youth vote and start paying attention to our future.

Interestingly, many of these same companies allow dogs in their offices every day of the year, but feel the need to have one special day dedicated to bringing one's offspring to work. I do say this somewhat in jest, since the origins of ""Take Your Child to Work"" stem from the objective of exposing children to various careers versus being born out of parental convenience or necessity.

That said, at various times in my career -- as a parent of a 3-month old working on Google's IPO, for example -- I've had a few perfect storms where I didn't have the luxury of waiting for the annual invitation. Fortunately, Google made it comfortable and accepted to have children in the office occasionally, with a huge hat tip to @Susan Wojcicki. With support of the founders, Susan, then a new mom, was able to and did indeed set that tone of acceptance from Google's early days.

When I arrived at Urban Engines, it was important to me to continue this tradition, making it as natural as possible for kids to visit, while also being careful not to alienate or frustrate team members without children. Understandably, parents, including me, tend to be apprehensive about bring their children into the office, even with the most tolerant of environments. So here are a few tips:

1. Bring Your Kids to Work

Yes, this seems obvious, but company leadership -- both men and women -- should bring their children to work occasionally and naturally, without fanfare, demonstrating that it's not controversial for employees to do this, too, if done respectfully. It's a huge benefit for parents to feel comfortable having their kids in the office, either in a pinch or to capitalize on a serendipitous school holiday and a rare free lunch hour.  

2. Don't Wait Until It's Mission Critical or Girl Scout Cookie Season

Just like fire drills, having a plan and limiting surprises will help you be ready in case of a real emergency. So have your kids visit the office when it's not needed and when you're not soliciting your fellow employees, which you shouldn't do anyway, but that's a whole other topic.

Pick a day with light meetings for you, no big clients visiting, etc. Come prepared with items to keep your child well-fed and entertained. If you can book a dedicated conference room, do it. Give your kids a chance to have a positive experience with you at work when you're not in panic mode. And have an exit strategy just in case it doesn't work out.

2. OK At Any Age

Here are some more specific things to think about depending on the age of your child:

Infants - Bring extra clothes for you and your child (and plenty of extra diapers for your child). Make sure you have a place for them to hang out, whether it's in their car seat, in pack 'n play or on a clean blanket on the floor. Don't try to get your child down for a nap in the office unless you're exceptionally good at it (not me!) or it's absolutely necessary. And if your child starts to cry, and he will, don't worry about it -- we tend to think our children sound louder than everyone else thinks they are -- although booking that conference room for your own peace of mind isn't a bad idea....

Toddlers - Again, it's good to have extra clothes on hand and a conference room reserved. Also with a more mobile child, do a quick child-proofing of the area, picking up any stray staples, locking down surrounding adjustable chairs so little hands can't get stuck, and even bringing in some of those outlet covers from home. Bring a selection of favorite toys, comfort items and foods for your little one.

Preschool and grade school - Once they are a little older, the office can be an adventure if you set the ground rules for everyone. Letting kids write on whiteboards, choose their own snacks from the breakroom, and, of course, entertain themselves with a movie in that conference room you've booked is a huge win for most kids. For kids who have homework, each or all of these things can be the perfect carrot to bring assignments to completion. And the office is a perfect opportunity for children to practice their good manners with willing co-workers.

I recognize that it's not appropriate for every job or every company to have children in the workplace, either scheduled or unexpectedly. But if you're fortunate enough to be in an environment where it works and people are supportive, count your blessings and seize the opportunity. And if you are fortunately enough to be in a position where it works and you can create that support, count your blessings and make it happen. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

Around that time, I would approach each April bracing myself for another Mother's day without a child of my own, and I would bristle when my manicurist casually asked me if I had kids, but none of that did me in. I was OK. I was, thank goodness, past the super-sensitive phase of my grief when it felt  like the whole world was one big glowing and ouchy reminder of what I didn't have and what I most wanted. During that time, I remember feeling as if every person I saw was a product of a totally normal and natural biological act that I had not been able to complete -- and basically to see a human was a reminder of my failure. Happily, this was a short-lived period of extreme sensitivity. The point is that grief changes, and eventually, grief dissipates.

This time, for example, the Royal baby buzz doesn't seem to be as fevered as it was the first time round, or maybe it is just where I am. I have gotten to the phase of my recovery where seeing babies no longer breaks my heart. I can see them, enjoy them, coo over their chubby cheeks and even hold one without dissolving into a big royal train wreck. I even actually don't always mind handing them back to their mothers when they start to fuss and cry.

I haven't actually kept up with this Royal pregnancy. I think I read something about how Kate had suffered terrible morning sickness again, which sounds awful. I don't envy her that, but the bigger truth is that I don't envy her, full stop. And that is what I am really writing to tell you -- what this post is really about. It's to tell you that if you are childless-not-by-choice, and you are in the midst of your grief, I want you to know that you very likely won't always feel as sad as you do now and that a day will come where you will see pregnant woman and babies without feeling like you just got socked in the ovaries. It will happen. 

And I am also here to tell you that it takes more then time to heal these wounds: it takes grieving, and processing, and a whole lot of work, but you can get there. If I can get here you can get here. Maybe you can't imagine that you will ever get to that place if you just found out that yet another IVF round didn't lead to conception, but someday soon when Prince Harry and Princess Name-Yet-To-Be-Determined have their first Royal bundle you will be where I am and you will remember that I told you that you too would no longer be aching as you were, and that you would move on from your grief to create a happy and meaningful life with or without kids. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

Hammond is not alone. Police departments across the nation are adopting the use of body cameras in the wake of high-profile police-related deaths like those of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York City, although the long-term effects of this practice are not yet clear. Early evidence reveals a mixed bag: decreases in community complaints against cops as well as unexpected surveillance and budget liabilities for police departments. 

But for Hammond Mayor Thomas McDermott, the decision to spring for cameras was easy. 

""When Hammond was in the national news [in 2014], there was nothing else going on but [our] trying to defend ourselves. Business stopped for a week -- we had satellite crews here 24/7,"" McDermott told The Huffington Post on Tuesday, a day after he announced the start of the body camera program. ""I never want to go through that again.""  

In September 2014, Lisa Mahone was driving, along with her boyfriend Jamal Jones and two children, to visit Mahone's ill mother when they were pulled over by Hammond officers on a seat belt violation. Mahone's 14-year-old son recorded what happened next: A police officer smashed the window of the family's car and stunned Jones with a Taser after he refused to get out of the vehicle. The incident prompted a federal lawsuit against the department and an FBI investigation.

Hammond has now paid $160,000 for 156 Axon cameras from Taser International plus the price of storing the daily recorded footage -- a cost that came in after the year's budget had more or less been decided, McDermott said. 

""We had an incentive that other PDs didn’t have,"" McDermott said. ""We had to reprioritize."" 

The mayor said ""the public is happy"" to have the cameras and even the police force has embraced them.

“Traditionally, before 2014, the police department, the union itself and members of the Fraternal Order of Police were the ones who didn’t want this type of camera, and now they enthusiastically support it,"" McDermott said. ""It helps everyone out. It helps police in the case of a difficult arrest, and it helps the citizen if the police officer is acting aggressively or improperly.""

McDermott said the cameras will also benefit judges, juries, the police chief and the mayor himself.  

""I don’t want to see a 30-second snippet of [an incident that's under question]. I want to see the whole thing,"" McDermott said. ""I’d like to think I’m not biased one way or another when it comes to arrests, but this is going to make my job easier as mayor so appropriate punishment can be handed down as necessary. And it can help the public because usually when it’s an officer's word against the civilian's, the police officer usually wins."" 

He also hopes footage of disputed incidents will quell unrest among citizens if it shows that officers, in fact, acted fairly.

Hammond police have used dashboard cameras for the past 16 years, but the mayor said body cameras are ""a natural response to cell phone cameras."" 

As part of the new program, officers will undergo specialized training in procedural justice and police legitimacy, which is designed to help them ""give the citizens they encounter a voice by listening, remain neutral while making decisions, show respect and build trust within the community,"" the mayor's office said in a statement.  

Hammond's police force is the first in northwest Indiana to adopt body-worn cameras as part of the standard issue equipment for uniformed officers. Neighboring Gary launched a pilot program in March. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

102a801726f1d26f0a3d4bcfc101e1ba,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sarah-casson/resting-on-the-smallest-w_b_7107700.html,Resting on the Smallest Wings: The Flight of Conservation,"""Learning how to successfully kill a butterfly is what we're here to do,"" said Dr. Andrew Brower, professor at Middle Tennessee State University and an expert on Nymphalid butterflies. He addressed a room full of students, researchers and naturalists at the Serra Bonita Reserve, located in the Atlantic Forest, or Mata Atlântica, of Bahía, Brazil. Over 70 percent of the room was under the age of 30, and they were all, in one form or another, there to study butterflies and moths. With only 8 percent of the original ecosystem remaining, the Atlantic Forest of Brazil urgently needs all the conservation help it can get. And the next generation of scientists is ready to help.

Lepidopterists -- studiers of scaly-winged, curling-hollow-tongued butterflies and moths (the Lepidoptera) -- help provide fascinating science that naturally lends itself to conservation stories. A group of these researchers, including the authors, spent two weeks with the conservation team at the Serra Bonita Reserve to deliver crucial information about the health of the remaining Brazilian Atlantic Forest. 

With its extremely high levels of biodiversity, much of which is endemic only to this rainforest, Serra Bonita Reserve has been globally recognized as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. The Brazilian Atlantic Forest represents one of the most important and endangered ecosystems in the world. 

""Some birders -- from Bird Life International, I think it was -- came by one day to see the birds,"" said Vitor Becker, owner of the Serra Bonita Reserve. ""Sitting on the porch,"" he explained, ""the researchers recorded 140 species of birds in a day. And they never even left the porch."" Serra Bonita Reserve, with a total of 400 bird species now recorded, is a family-run private reserve of 17,000 acres created to protect and study the remnants of this forest and its inhabitants. 

The moth and butterfly collections created by the lepidopterist researchers during this trip, representing 40 different families (4,000 individuals) -- and the many more specimens in Vitor's private collection -- play an essential role in the forest's protection. 

Dr. Bower explained to the newer collectors: ""You're not decimating butterfly populations from collecting. You're contributing to the body of knowledge that helps conserve them."" This body of scientific knowledge shows why a region should be conserved for its biodiversity and what species benefit from the conservation of an ecosystem. 

To soothe anyone's worries about indiscriminate insect execution, Dr. Bower referred to a 2001 study by McKenna et al., saying that ""the number of Lepidoptera killed by cars and trucks along roadways for the entire state of Illinois for one week is 20,000,000 individuals.""

As Dr. Bower spoke about the techniques of a successful butterfly kill, smoke rose in the valley below us. The endangered forest was being burned to create new cow pastures: a reminder of the looming threats of habitat loss. And so each day we hiked into the rainforest armed with large, soft white nets and tiny envelopes to capture and hold the specimen. The intrigue of butterflies and moths is only useful to current conservation science efforts once an exhaustive database of specimens has been collected. 

While we walked through dense jungle that extended over a hundred feet above our heads, the researchers discussed moth specimen presentation, specialized parasites of caterpillars, bat-butterfly ultrasound interactions, and the evolutionary branching of butterflies from the tropical savannah. Most researchers had a favorite Lepidoptera family for studying: Noctuidae, Limacodidae, Nymphalidae. (Or: ""nocturnal moths"", ""slug caterpillars"", ""brushfooted butterflies"".) 

A local Brazilian example of butterfly-centric conservation lies within one of the most thoroughly studied butterfly groups: the genus Heliconius, or longwings. One species of longwing, Heliconius nattereri, has been found to live only in a tiny slice of habitat within the Atlantic Forest. 

""Everybody knows about Heliconius nattereri in that region now,"" said Dr. Jim Miller, course professor and research associate from the American Museum of Natural History. ""Even the people who didn't know about butterflies know it. Before, we could save the forests with flagship organisms like the golden lion tamarin or the harpy eagle. Now we can do that with Heliconius nattereri."" 

But such conservation stories can only be told when based on sound scientific research. Any conservation story based on arbitrary or unsupported science hurts the larger conservation agenda. 

""I only support storytelling [of conservation issues] if it has good, thorough science behind it,"" said Dr. Lee Dyer, professor of Biology at the University of Nevada, Reno. The other lepidopterists agree: accurate, exhaustive, unbiased scientific research is required before stories can be shared.

Luckily for Serra Bonita Reserve conservationists, butterflies and moths lend themselves to both intriguing studies and fascinating stories, from big iridescent blue Morpho butterflies to spikey Saturniidae moth caterpillars. But Lepidoptera do not function like most iconic conservation species. Most species that are chosen to represent a landscape-scale conservation project, such as the North American Grizzly Bear, have an easily identified influence on the entire ecosystem. For butterflies and moths, the species spread and their environmental effects are less well known, but are still important to interconnected ecosystems. 

The conservation of butterflies is the conservation of species interactions. Scientists estimate that 11,000 species of butterflies and moths live at Serra Bonita, the same number found in the U.S. and Canada combined. Many of these Lepidoptera species are endemic to the higher elevations along the reserve's mountain ridge, requiring specific conditions to survive. They have particular needs -- it is common for their caterpillar stage to require a single species of plant to eat -- and finding a mate involves complex biogeochemical interactions. To protect Lepidoptera is to protect a diversity of plant, bat, ant and parasite species, all of which depend on the presence of Lepidoptera and upon which Lepidoptera depend. 

Thus far, the Serra Bonita Reserve is protecting the butterflies and moths in a small corner of the remaining Atlantic Forest, while also keeping the cow pastures at bay. It's no wonder that families and rising conservation leaders alike are increasingly focusing their efforts on private realm land protection. Though painstaking and complex in its execution, private conservation is the best option in many endangered landscapes and is gaining more attention today in the environmental realm globally. Even in the U.S., the Land Trust Alliance reports that private land trusts have protected 47 million acres of land, which is over half the entire acreage currently under the U.S. National Park Service's protection. The trend is growing, too, with 10 million new acres of land since 2005. According to the Land Trust Alliance, private land trusts are the fastest growing segment of the conservation community in the U.S. The protection of these lands and similar areas across the globe often starts with the concerns of private citizens.

Vitor and Clemira Becker, owners of the private Serra Bonita Reserve, were living in Brasilia, 600 miles away from the Reserve, when they began to see the destruction of the Atlantic Forest. Each trip to the rainforest to gather specimens for their collection heightened their worries. Frustrated by the failure of national government-established protected areas, and alarmed by the damages, they took action themselves. The couple sold their home and gathered together their savings and retirement pension to buy a plot of relatively untouched forest on the slopes of the Serra Bonita mountain range, overlooking the old cacao farming municipality of Camacan. 

""They even sold part of their moth collection,"" their daughter, Moema, said in a confiding tone. Thousands of hours go into collecting, pinning and cataloguing individual insects, and a serious collection represents both a scientific archive and a lifetime achievement. But the sacrifice of selling part of their Lepidoptera collection was crucial: the forest, one of the most biodiverse places in the world, was diminishing rapidly and national efforts were poor at best.

Today, urgent threats to the forest are never far from the Becker family's minds. In the past 10 years, the family and the reserve's corresponding NGO, the Uriaçu Institute, have protected 2,200 hectares. They hope their continued efforts of research and outreach will find pockets of like-minded partners who can help save the remaining 7,500 hectares of the Serra Bonita mountain range, critical habitat within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. 

As climate change worsens and poses a heightened threat to endangered ecosystems like the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest, the continued conservation work of the Serra Bonita Reserve will prove essential in protecting a plethora of species from extinction. 

""Losing a species is like losing a library full of books,"" said Dr. Dyer to the roomful of young researchers. Each species and its diverse interactions is a Shakespearian play, he continued, and threats ranging from habitat destruction to climate change are destroying a library that, in many cases, has never been read. 

It is too late to save the entire Atlantic Forest library, but the work of next generation researchers and conservationists continues to bring to light new intriguing species, many never before known to science -- new interactions, and new hope for the remaining ecosystem -- one butterfly book at a time.

It's the perfect time to relax, let loose and complain about husbands/kids/other friends. It's always something to look forward to, especially when it's with a group of moms. You know, the ones that have kids the same age as yours, and you all just ""click"" and have a great time together. Much like an episode of ""Sex and the City,"" all the moms have very distinct characteristics, and there's always one of each in the group. Here are the five moms of girls night out:

1. The Flakey Mom. She's the one who excitedly talks about the get-together all week leading up to it and sends cute texts about how she ""can't wait"" to hang out. When you walk into the restaurant, one of the other gals tells you she's not coming, since she's tired/kids are sick/husband is working late. There's always a good excuse, but she always bails!

2. The Way-Too-Happy-to-Be-There Mom. She's the one who is starved for adult interaction, since she's home with the kids all day long. Everything is amazing and dramatic for this mom, since it doesn't involve homework, diapers or laundry. ""The food is so delicious! TRY IT,"" ""Your hair is so soft! CAN I KEEP TOUCHING IT?"", ""Oh my gosh, did you see Ellen today?!  HILARIOUS!!!""

3. The Unhappily Married Mom. She's constantly on the look out for hot men, single or not, and comments on what she'd do to them, ""Oh, look at that one. He's yummy. If I got my hands on him, I'd rock his world."" After a couple of glasses of wine, she ends up flirting with the waiter. This actually ends up being fun, since most of the time, dessert (or the whole check) ends up being comped.

4. The Know-It-All Mom. This is the mom who makes comments on every story you tell about what she'd do differently, or what you did wrong. Her family is always picture-perfect, and she's the modern-day June Cleaver. Why is she in the group, anyway?

5. Too Cool for You Mom.  Who can she possibly be texting, when all her friends are right there with her? Yet, she manages to keep her nose in her phone all night long, constantly asking, ""What did you say?"" or ""What did I miss?""

Be honest: Which girls' night out mom are you?

Part 1 and Part 2 of this series carried some great examples. Here are some more...

11. Distance of the Sun from the Earth:

Mythological Reference: According to Indian legend, Hanuman (The monkey god) mistook the setting sun to be an inviting fruit and flew all the way to the sun, only to be disappointed. The Hanuman Chalisa, a famous story-chant, also mentions this event and includes a mathematical reference.

The lines ""Jug Sahasra Yojan Par Bhanu"" reveal the distance he travelled to the Sun.

1 Jug = 12,000 years; Sahasra = 1,000 years; yojan= eight miles, which makes its 12000*1000*8 ~ 9,60,00,000 miles which is approximately  15,36,00,000 km.

 Today's Science: The distance between the Sun and the Earth is reported as approximately 150,000,000 Km.



12. Leeches used in treatment:

Mythological Reference: Indian legend has it that when the great ccean was churned, a broad-chested man appeared with leeches in one hand and herbs in the other. He was called Dhnvanthari, the father of medicine, especially Ayurveda. This form of the 'first doctor' is worshipped in several famous temples of South India to this day.

Today's Science: Leeches are increasing being viewed as a radical tool for treatment;  classified as Live Medical Devices. In 2004, the FDA cleared the use of Leech Therapy for medical purposes. (Reference: Pride of India, Samskrita Bharathi)



13. Surrogate Motherhood:

 Mythological reference: The Mahabharata mentions that Balarama's biological mother, Devaki, transferred her womb to another woman, Rohini, to safeguard the child from her wicked brother, Kamsa.

Today's science: Gestational Surrogacy is a widely accepted alternative to natural conception today.

 14. Atomic Warfare:

Mythological reference:  The Mahabharata's great final war was akin to an Atomic war. The weapon of Brahma, called 'Brahmastra,' was known to be incredibly potent -- which could produce explosions that were brighter than a 'thousand suns.' After the war, there are references to people losing hair and nails, suggesting that weapons of mass destruction were indeed used in the war.

Today's science: Dr. Oppenheimer, the creator of the atomic bomb refers to the Mahabharata and the Bhagavad Gita as the inspiration behind his invention. Traces of Radioactive material and enormous destruction were excavated. When Dr. Oppenheimer was questioned by a student if the bomb detonated at Alamogordo was the first, he replied, ""In Modern Times, of course!""

15. Sex Change:

Mythological Reference: Indian Legend has it that Vishnu, the Protector among the Trinity, took the female form of Mohini and Shiva (The destroyer) fell in love with her. Their union gave birth to a son, who later killed another demon.

Today's Science: Today we hear about 'miracle stories' of men giving birth to children after sex change surgeries and hormone therapy. This is still a long way to go from the story, where a man completely transforms into a woman and then gives birth. We are still at the stage where women can change their sex and yet keep their female reproductive organs to successfully bear children.

The Relevance  

There is perennial debate on whether these stories were pure figments of imagination or if there is evidence of technical know-how in these stories. This debate is something we would rely on our archeologists and scientists to answer. (Some of the references above suggest sound technical knowledge). However, that is another matter (perhaps fodder for another post).

What matters is the potential of these stories to fire up sparks all over their little heads. What matters is the potential of all cultures and mythological contexts to make similar connections.

The next time you start with, ""Once upon a time, long long ago... don't stop with that. Connect the dots with them all the way to their todays and tomorrows. And who knows? That little private horse could just become a reality by the time I become a grandparent!

After all, didn't Einstein say, ""If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairy tales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairy tales.""

Michael Rule, 51, has been charged with theft in the first degree and forgery, for allegedly writing himself $103,628 in checks from his mother's bank account, according to charging documents. Andrew Rule, 54, was accused of coercing his mother into giving him $23,327 and was charged with first-degree theft. Both are free on their own recognizance awaiting trial.

Ann Rule, 84, the author of 30 New York Times bestsellers, has been in declining health since an October 2013 fall that resulted in a broken hip, according to court documents provided to The Huffington Post by the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office in Washington state. She ""is on oxygen at all times,"" suffers from periods of ""extreme confusion"" and is ""vulnerable to undue influence,"" the documents say.

""She is unable to perform many activities of daily living without assistance,"" the court documents state.

Her sons began taking advantage of her weakness last year, according to prosecutors. 

Authorities were alerted on March 2, when Rule's son-in-law, Glen Scorr, told the prosecutor's office he suspected his mother-in-law was being financially exploited by her two sons.

A joint investigation by the King County Sheriff's Office and the Normandy Park Police Department revealed that four of Ann Rule's children receive an estimated $25,000 monthly salary through her corporation, Rule Enterprises LLC, for ""assigned responsibilities."" 

Michael Rule, who lives on a property adjoining his mother's Normandy Park home, allegedly pressured her into providing him with funds above his monthly salary. He forged her signature on checks from March 2014 to February 2015, authorities said.

Michael Rule's pressure on his mother included verbal abuse, authorities said. He would ""yell at his mother demanding money as she cowered in her wheelchair,"" the court documents allege. Once, he became so angry that he ""screamed at her and threw a cellphone across the room, smashing it to pieces,"" according to the documents.

Police said Ann Rule told investigators that ""Mike often goes into rages, where he throws things across the room and sweeps a counter clean with his arm."" One of Ann Rule's caregivers quit because she was ""afraid of Mike and his volatile temper,"" the documents say.

Andrew Rule also was aggressive in his pursuit of his mother's money during 2014, authorities said.

""Andy would pester and bully Ann relentlessly for money, sometimes threatening suicide, sometimes trying to make her feel guilty, sometimes screaming obscenities at her, until she would finally give in and write him a check,"" the court documents allege.

Ann Rule was granted a protection order against Andrew Rule in January. He was arrested and charged with violating the order on March 27, police said.

While in police custody, Andrew Rule told officers he ""has battled drug and gambling addictions for years and that he used the money provided to him by his mother on gambling and strip clubs,"" the court documents state.

Ann Rule declined to comment on the allegations against her children. Her books include The Stranger Beside Me, about the serial killer Ted Bundy. 

Neither Michael Rule nor Andrew Rule were available for comment on Tuesday. During an interview with KIRO-TV of Seattle, Andrew Rule denied wrongdoing.

""I have never in my life, as God as my witness, stolen anything whatsoever from my mom,"" he told the station. ""Basically I used to have a gambling problem but I don’t anymore and I have absolutely no idea why I was pulled in at the same time my brother was,"" Rule continued.

Dan Donohoe, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office, told HuffPost the brothers are scheduled to be arraigned on April 30.

Typically, there is a lot of fighting, tension and disrespect (the house is full of W.M.D. -- Whining, Manipulation and Disrespect).They're frustrated, unhappy and stuck. They're also often scared about what the future holds.

When this happens, it's very energy draining -- at least for the parents. Oddly enough, the teen often thrives on the chaos as it gives them a sense of power. It's not a healthy sense of power, but it's power nevertheless. 

When I help them peel back the layers of the onion, one of the things I often see is the parents lack self-confidence in two common, but related ways:

1. What it means to be the appropriate authority figure at home

2. What rules they want for their home

Building up this self-confidence is critical to restoring balance at home. It's the first step in reducing the terrible stress of being at odds with your children and everything that comes with it (stress in your marriage, negative impact on your other children and loss of joy at home, to name a few).

Here are four basic principles parents need to work on to build their self-confidence and take back control of the emotional thermostat in their home.

1. You are the pack leader. As funny as it may sound, it can be useful to think of your family for a moment as a dog pack. In this pack, you are the indisputable pack leader -- the ""alpha."" It's your pack and you ultimately say what goes and what doesn't. Other members of the pack are loved and valued and can respectfully provide input, but at the end of the day, you're the pack leader -- the parent and adult -- so you have the final say. 

Action Step 1: take a deep, deep breath and step confidently into your role as the pack leader. Own it. 

2. Go with your gut. Many parents second-guess themselves when it comes to the rules of their home. They're afraid others (i.e. their teens) won't like them, and this then leads to a cascade of fear and self-doubt. As a result, they often have ambiguous rules that seem constantly up for negotiation. The solution is to go with your gut. Trust that you have a reliable sense of what is right and wrong for your home and your kids. If your intentions are good and you're being reasonable, you'll be hitting the mark far more often that not. 

Action step: Take five minutes to sit alone quietly. Close your eyes, put your feet flat on the floor, take some deep breaths, and let your mind and body settle down a bit. Think of a situation where you need to set a rule or limit with your teen. Regardless of the reaction you might encounter, what does your gut tell you is the right way to go with it? Learn to listen, and then run with it.

3. Stop explaining yourself. An extension of going with your gut is realizing you don't have to constantly explain your choices when it comes to your teens. Let go of feeling like you have to explain yourself and justify your rules. Your teen doesn't have to always like them, but as long as they're living in your home, they have to accept them. This doesn't mean you can't be open to their feedback (as long as it's respectfully communicated) and take it into consideration. But once you've made up your mind, don't feel that you owe your teen an elaborate explanation -- and don't let them goad you into thinking you do. Your rules are your rules, plain and simple. 

Action step: Next time you're drawn into a debate or negotiation with your teen, catch yourself, and get out of it. Calmly restate your position on the matter, explain to your teen that she doesn't have to like it but she does have to accept it, and walk away.

4. You always have the trump card. Finally, it's important to realize that as the pack leader, you always have the trump card. Often, parents hesitate to set limits because they're afraid how their teen will respond when they hear the word ""no."" They fear their teen will escalate with anger and start tantruming or making threats. If this is a situation you're facing, realize that as the parent and adult, you always have the trump card. Whether it's giving consequences for bad behavior, withdrawing privileges or at the very extreme, exploring ways to move your teen out of the house for a period of time, being self-confident means knowing you always have the last say. This doesn't mean it will always be easy, but where there's a will, there's a way. The alternative is allowing your teen run your home through threat and intimidation. 

Action step: List out the leverage points you can use as consequences when your teen behaves poorly. Think of everything that's in play (i.e. cell phone, use of the car, a summer trip with friends, come and go privileges on the weekends, paying for college, etc.). It doesn't mean you have to use any or all of them, but part of having the trump card is knowing they're on the table.

Building this self-confidence takes time. It doesn't mean you have to walk around with a puffed out chest letting everybody who walks through your door know you're the boss. But it does mean developing the quiet inner resolve and certainty that it's your home, and you can shape the emotional climate of it in the way you want. Take a deep breath. You can do this.

9d364b9a9be0cf121ea504566dc64ba0,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/21/california-vaccination-bill_n_7112726.html,California Lawmaker To Revive Bill Requiring Vaccinations Despite Personal Beliefs,"By Sharon Bernstein

SACRAMENTO, Calif., April 21 (Reuters) - The author of a California bill to require school children to be vaccinated for such diseases as polio and measles regardless of their parents' personal beliefs said he would revive the measure, which stalled in the legislature last week.

The bill, introduced in the wake of a measles outbreak that began at Disneyland and sickened 147 people last year, was pulled before it could come to a vote in the Senate education committee last week amid intense opposition from religious groups and parents who fear side-effects from vaccines.

""These diseases not only paralyzed our country with fear, there are many people living amongst us who still bear the ravages of these diseases,"" said state Senator Richard Pan, a Democrat from Sacramento. ""Why would we not demand that children be vaccinated before they enter school?""

Pan, a pediatrician, was flanked by two elderly polio survivors in wheelchairs as he announced that he would bring the bill up for consideration a second time in the Senate education committee on Wednesday.

He chided opponents of the bill who downplay the risks of the disease, which he said crippled up to 35,000 people a year in the United States before the vaccine became widespread.

Measles, he said, can cause hearing loss, encephalitis, pneumonia and death.

Authored by Pan and Democratic Senator Ben Allen of Santa Monica, the bill would end the so-called personal beliefs exemption in California's vaccination law, which allows parents to opt out if they have religious or other opposition to vaccination. It would still allow parents to opt out if a doctor says the child should not be vaccinated for medical reasons.

All U.S. states require vaccinations for children entering school unless they have a medical reason to avoid the shots, such as a weak immune system.

Most states also allow parents to opt out if their religion bans the protective procedure and about 20 allow personal beliefs exemptions, which in recent years have been used by parents who fear a now-debunked link between vaccines and autism, or worry about other health effects of children receiving shots.

Opposition from parents, many of them affluent and well-educated, have managed to kill similar bills introduced in the wake of the Disneyland outbreak, including one in Oregon.

Under a new provision added to the bill on Tuesday, unvaccinated children would be allowed to study together in organized private home-school environments.

1b1b0d7a14b28f7db21db5e8a7577df5,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/monica-bauer/pulitzer-prize-winning-play-and-a-winning-director-_b_7107500.html,"Pulitzer Prize Winning Play, and a Winning Director, Too","The Pulitzer Prize for Drama was given to the writer of a fast and funny and poignant new American play that I had the good fortune to see, Between Riverside and Crazy. The Pulitzer is awarded to a playwright, but I'd argue there should be a citation in there somewhere for the director of the first production. 

A brand new play comes into the world gestated by a playwright, sometimes for as long as a decade, the ideas growing and developing until they demand to see the light of day. But the midwife whose job it is to insure that the baby comes out alive and kicking is the director. And Stephen Adly Guirgis had the good fortune to have Austin Pendleton in the delivery room.

I say that as a playwright myself, and one who has worked with many directors, including (full disclosure) Austin Pendleton, on the first steps of a new play, the early readings. Taking nothing away from the playwright, let's add at least a paragraph about the director to all these articles about the new Pulitzer Prize winning play. 

Theater is a team sport; surely the actors, and the designers too, get credit for their efforts in the development of a new play. An actor's own speech patterns are suggestive of a new line here, a question from a designer clarifies the plot for the playwright. A lot can happen in the unseen world of new play development that fundamentally alters the course of a play. But most theater professionals would agree that the lion's share of shaping comes in the fertile and sometimes frantic process of a playwright and a director, huddled together after rehearsal, deep in thought and conversation. 

Directors like Pendleton don't want the credit; they reflect it back on the playwright and modestly demur that they were lucky to be part of it all. But we playwrights know when we get lucky as well. Virtually every review of the show mentioned the terrific direction given  in not just one, but two productions of Between Riverside and Crazy just months apart, a rare thing in New York theater history, both productions helmed by Austin Pendleton.

Some might argue that the Pulitzer is supposed to be an award purely for the script, unlike the Obies or the Tonys or the Outer Critics Circle Awards, where the prize for Best Play cannot help but be influenced by the production. Everyone in theater understands that seeing a production on stage deeply influences the way the work is perceived, even by a jury of the most scrupulous peers. 

A bad play with great performances and superb direction sometimes makes it into the winner's circle for numerous awards, but then fails to catch on in subsequent productions. And there are rare cases, such as Nilo Cruz's win for Anna in the Tropics, where the Pulitzer came before the first production. 

But as a working playwright, I'd argue that even in the case of Anna in the Tropics, the script that is read by the Pulitzer Prize Committee comes with a history of false starts, dropped subplots, and often a whole variety of possible endings that came and went during the process of hearing the play read or in a staged reading, and each of these readings came with a director willing to patiently sit with the writer and go, sometimes word by word and action by action, through a new script. 

So let's hear it for the playwright Stephen Adly Guirgis, whose imagination, comic timing, sense of pace and diction have given us many fine plays, including his latest, the Pulitzer Prize winning Between Riverside and Crazy. But let's also tip the hat to the director who helped him get there. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

I ended up losing my mother, my father and my little brother, and I was paralyzed from the chest down. The last thing I remember before passing out was being trapped in the back seat, unable to move, begging my family to tell me that they were okay but knowing deep down that they were already gone. It was a horrific crash that still haunts me to this day, but that's a story I've already told.

This is about the future.

After getting out of the hospital, I knew that I wanted to use my story to try to keep others from having to suffer as I did. I started by sharing my story with high school students and drunk driving offenders, but I felt like my words were only doing so much.

So I started Drive Clear, a nonprofit dedicated to preventing drunk driving. But we wanted to do more than to just ask people to drink responsibly -- we wanted to give people the tools to take responsibility. And so to accomplish this mission, we made it our goal to get personal breathalyzers into the hands of as many people as possible through our special partnership with BACtrack.

We believe that through personal breathalyzer technology, we can substantially reduce the incidence of drunk driving. We believe in people and their ability to make responsible decisions. When it comes drunk driving, what people are missing is a way to ensure that they are safe and legal to drive, no matter what the circumstances.

We settled on our prevention initiative after surveying the current landscape of drunk driving prevention nonprofits. There were many great organizations encouraging people to avoid drinking, to have a designated driver, or to have an alternative way to get home. And while these are all preferable options, we felt that it's not realistic to always expect people to avoid alcohol when going out or to have a backup option in place.

Some people want to have a glass of wine with dinner or a beer while watching a ball game or a martini while on the dance floor and expect to drive home at the end of the night. These people deserve to get home safely and we want to make that happen.

Really, the inspiration for our prevention initiative came after a high school student asked me a question during one of my speeches. She wanted to know who or what I blamed most for my loss. Was it the driver, alcohol addiction, our drinking culture, or even the alcohol companies themselves? In that moment, I was surprised by my gut reaction but I stuck with it.

I told her that the fault belonged entirely with the man driving the van while drunk. I told her that we are all responsible for the decisions that we make and that includes driving drunk. But in my mind, I had to ask -- is it was possible for a person to make sure that they were being responsible if they ended drinking and needed to get home? I was surprised by the twinge of sympathy I felt for the person who put me in my wheelchair and stole my family from me. I thought if only he had a way to check himself, maybe none of this would've happened.

Well, now there's a way. Maybe together, we can make sure it never happens again. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

A newly discovered species of glass frog has been found hiding in the rainforests of Costa Rica, and it looks nearly identical to Jim Henson's Muppet masterpiece. Hyalinobatrachium dianae was first documented in a study released earlier this year by Brian Kubicki, the founder of the Costa Rican Amphibian Research Center, and two other researchers. The darling little jumper wasn't named after its doppelganger, however, but after Kubicki's mother, Janet Diane Kubicki.



The Kermit lookalike differs from other glass frogs thanks to a combination of physical characteristics and unique vocalizations, Kubicki said.

""The advertisement call that the males of this species produce are very unique; no other known species of frog has a similar call and this was indeed one of the traits that we used for the justification of it being a completely new species,"" he told CBS News.



There are more than 100 species of glass frogs, which have a semi-transparent stomach that makes their organs visible. With the addition of Kubicki's discovery, Costa Rica is now home to 14 different species of the tropical amphibians.

And seriously, in case you still can't see the resemblance, just look at the eyes.

I recently lost a friend of mine. We met under slightly unusual circumstances.

We had just finished moving. A street lamp cast a lazy, hazy glow over us as we smiled at a job well done.

Out of nowhere came a raucous, ""Meow!"" There was this ginger tabby, skinny and tall with a hungry desperation in his eyes.

His attitude was, ""Somebody feed me now!""

I moved towards it and it came straight up to me. I picked this stately creature up and discovered it had no claws on its front paws. 

""You have to take it in. There is no way that cat can defend itself,"" Michelle advised.

The next morning I created a sign which I went around the neighborhood with. It read:

""Ginger cat with half a tail found."" The cat had this stunted little tail. I figured it was a defining characteristic.


C.Z curled up and cosy. Note the trademark tiny tail.

I received many calls for cats with missing portions of tail, but none of them turned out a match. So, I adopted him.

His Character

He had a regal appearance, a handsome face and long lean body. I named him Caesar (after Julius) which quickly became C.Z.


C.Z relaxing with his pal George Michael.

It was great to have some company, although he was a snob and had a temper. His soul was untameable.

This dark side was evident when our dog Lucy, as a puppy, fell off the bed injuring her leg. She let out a desperate yelp. C.Z's pupils dilated and he moved in for the kill. Lucy never trusted him again. Attempted murder is a hard one to forgive. 

If a dog enters the place, C.Z goes on the warpath even though he has no claws. He is a no fear fighting machine that doesn't know when to quit. Reminds me of someone I know, intimately.

C.Z is the greediest cat in history. One night I had bought myself a doughnut (I had danced up a storm and was good for the calories). C.Z jumped over to me and began wildly trying to knock it out of my hand. In fact anything that was barely edible he consumed. I've seen him devour concentrated Zankou garlic sauce.

We ran a variety of tests but there was nothing wrong with him. He was just plain greedy.


Busted! George on the lookout while C.Z gets stuck into the food bag he stole from the cupboard.

He will watch you eat and start purring. The mere fact that someone is eating something turns him on.

Speaking of which, C.Z is also a chronic masturbator and loves to make an exhibition of himself. He will tear down a blanket and go to town on it right in front of you. He loves the attention, an attention whore if you will. 

Despite his serious psychological issues he displayed high intelligence.

He learned to use our toilet. 

Being food oriented he was a quick learner. When he realized he would get a treat anytime he used the toilet he started to drink copious amounts of water so he could pee more and get more treats. He also would hold his pee in if we were out, so when we returned he could do a ""performance pee"" to get a treat. Then he began fake peeing. 

He also bites you if you sing badly.

He also bites you if you annoy him. He is a really bitchy, irrational critic. I'm never that way.

One day we took him for a check-up. Dr. Tony got back to us with the news that C.Z had kidney disease.

His Illness

Suddenly he stopped eating. That had never happened. He shriveled up in front of our eyes and began to crawl under dark spaces looking for somewhere to suffer in silence. 

I watched as he stumbled towards the toilet and attempted to hop up onto the bowl like a good kitty, but he was too weak and fell. It was a heartbreaking moment of heroism from the anti-hero.

He couldn't walk and dragged his back legs, swerving over the floor like he was mad drunk, his eyes tightened into slits.

When he went into hospital, it was touch and go.

He was horizontal for the first few days. On day five when I visited, he was able to get up. He was happy to see me and rubbed up against me and I rubbed his ears. He liked that. It was wonderful to see him alive though not fully kicking.

He was put on a new diet and seemed less sleazy and more affectionate and, thankfully, as greedy as ever.

I appreciated him more than ever as the miraculous creature he was.

A month later he crashed again, however, and went back into hospital. This time he did not respond to treatment. His body failed.

We held his paw and stroked him gently as life left his body -- when the spark died in his fierce wild eyes.

Lessons From The Loss

C.Z  wasn't the most charming of fellows but his loss left a big wide hole in my heart. I never knew how much he meant to me until he was gone.

Grief seems vast and unbounded when it comes over you in its tidal surges. Death is so final and there is a strange emptiness that remains like a ghost.

I can't offer much wisdom for dealing with grief and death, but I do offer this: fill that hole with all the precious things that are meaningful.

It is easy to pass judgement. It is hard to appreciate those close to us in the fog of everyday life. We must remind ourselves to step back and view our fellow flawed miracles from a sympathetic perspective and an awareness of our collective mortality. 

You realize how fragile life is when someone is taken. Be grateful for the positive qualities in your family and friends.

We are here but for a moment. Honor the lives that touch you.

12f79764a9453b565c7fe8b0e16f7101,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/celia-kaye/wheat-celiac_b_7153786.html,What's So Bad About Wheat,"I was speaking with a friend the other day who commented that ""wheat is just so bad for you."" For me personally, yes, it is bad. Bad things happen to my insides when I consume gluten, the protein found in wheat and other grains such as rye and barley. For celiacs, my friend's comment couldn't be truer. But to hear my friend say that wheat in general is bad struck me as strange.

As I assessed my friend's claim, I noticed three things about the way our society functions that I suspected might contribute to the perplexing way my friend thinks about wheat.

1) Blogs provide the freedom to publish just about anything.

I publish blog posts on the website celiakaye.com. I could easily publish them without running them by editors or fact-checkers. I could write a post that is a list of ""healthy foods that are really bad for you,"" and I could write one about ""demonized foods that are actually healthy."" I could put wheat on both lists and publish them as if they were fact.

When I started writing about gluten sensitivity, I made a conscious decision to write about my experience. And though experience varies for everyone, in many cases the experiences I describe are deemed some variant of ""false"" by some readers who perhaps had an experience that differs from my own. Can experiences be said to be definitively true or false? No. Does a new logic apply to blogs that allows experience to be objective rather than subjective? No.

When is the last time you googled something and said to yourself ""I hope there's something written about this online""? It's not a thought that crosses my mind when I start typing in the search bar. I just assume that someone ""out there"" will have information on whatever topic I'm searching.

It occurred to me that because there is so much unfiltered information available online, perhaps we have developed our own internal filters. Some articles or posts might make factual claims that are in actuality unsupported by research, but they can make those claims unchecked because of the ease of Internet publishing. We read articles and sort them into two mental folders: things we believe, and things we don't believe (let's disregard the ""I don't know"" folder for now). Those mental folders, however, don't always correspond to what is actually true or false.

Did my friend read a compelling but ultimately unsupported argument for why wheat is bad? Did she read an experiential account of the consequences of ingesting wheat for a celiac? An anecdote of giving up gluten and shedding 15 pounds? Or maybe just an intriguing but misleading headline?

2) Provocative or catchy headlines are sometimes the only part of the article that is read, but they don't necessarily sum up the article.

Look at the title of this article. ""What's So Bad About Wheat"" might mislead you into thinking that the article is about all the ways wheat is bad for you. If you only read the headline, that might be your takeaway. You would miss the idea that ""what's so bad about wheat"" is the question I asked after my friend made the claim that wheat is ""just so bad for you.""

As I mentioned above, there is a lot of information online. A lot to read, a lot to retain. Say I'm reading an article online and the title of another article in the sidebar catches my eye. If it sounds better than what I'm currently reading, I'll abandon my current article and click on it. Short attention span? Perhaps. Clickbait? Likely. 

I happen to know that my friend weighs 10 pounds more than her goal weight. How long does she spend researching, talking to trusted dietitians, nutritionists, her fitness coach? Not very long. It's easier for her to go online and search ""five miracle exercises to lose every inch of belly fat in five days."" A few articles will pop up; she'll click on the first. Because it aligns with her wish to lose 10 pounds as soon as possible, she'll bookmark the page. She's hooked on the idea of it only taking five days because of her desire for instant gratification. She is willing to accept the first, simplest solution, because she wants it to be true.

So if she reads a headline that says, ""I stopped eating wheat and lost 15 pounds,"" it seems like a fairly straightforward cause-effect and she skips the article, retaining only the headline. Her takeaway: Stop eating wheat and lose weight. But what if in the article the author specifies that he didn't replace the wheat-containing sweets he used to eat with gluten-free sweets? If she had read that, my friend may have considered that the cause of the weight loss was likely a combination of cutting down on fat, sugar, and carbs.

3) We seem to always need a group to condemn or praise.

Has there been a time in recent history when there was no popular diet to follow? (Down with carbs! No, down with fat! No, down with wheat!) Or when there was no miracle superfood that was the new very best thing to eat? (Avocado is king! No, kale is king! No wait, coconut oil is king!)

Would we create groups to condemn if there were no ""bad"" groups, like we might pick fights when we're bored? What would happen if there were no foods to condemn?

Over the years, different foods have been deemed ""bad for you"" and ""good for you"" at different times. By cutting down tremendously or eliminating fat from our diets, we stocked up on carb-rich foods. Then carbs ""became"" unhealthy, and fruits took a fall alongside carbs. Now wheat is experiencing it's own fall from the idea that whole wheat = healthy, not surprisingly on the heels of an increased awareness of celiac disease.

The idea of ""everything in moderation"" seems pretty sensible, but it doesn't seem to work for us. (For celiacs, it would be ""everything in moderation except gluten."" For those with nut allergies: everything in moderation except nuts, etc.) Perhaps because everything in moderation doesn't seem ""active"" enough for us. It seems to be the case that if my friend wants to lose weight, she wants something real that she can grasp, some specific food group that she can demonize and eliminate because she will feel that she is actively dieting her way to weight loss. If there were no ""bad"" foods, she might wonder: ""Then why am I overweight?"" Portion control seems insufficient as a direct cause of weight loss. Perhaps because then it would be her own fault if she didn't lose weight: It's not that the brownie was bad, it was that she had two of them. It puts the blame on her.

How exactly my friend deduced that wheat is bad from everything she consumed (mentally as well as physically), I cannot know. But I suspect it is a combination of the availability of unchecked information on the internet, sexy headlines, and the need for a dietary scapegoat.

""I'm getting mother roles -- or not getting mother roles, but [those are] the roles that there's interest for me for -- it's not the girlfriend roles,"" she told host Ricky Camilleri on Monday, ""which is okay. I don't need to play the ingenue anymore.""

The ""American Crime"" star remembers being cast opposite Al Pacino, then 24 years her senior, in the 1993 film ""Carlito's Way,"" foreshadowing the ageist dichotomy that now afflicts her at age 51.

""I'm the woman who's saying, 'Of course it's going to be the young up-and-coming actress against the older actor, and yeah, it sucks!'"" she admitted. ""It sucks. I do find that it's frustrating.""

Luckily the actress' ABC series has won rave reviews from critics, and it offers her a chance to play an stirring three-dimensional character.

""The great thing about television, I gotta say, is that there are really good roles for actresses of my age,"" she said. ""[But] you just have to keep working, and that's the thing. My agents just have to remind me that you just gotta go where there's good parts and you just have to kind of get your ego out of the way.""

The news could not possibly be good. Fearfully, I called my brother in Vancouver. A 7.8 Richter scale earthquake had hit Nepal. The earthquake had destroyed many parts of Kathmandu where my elderly parents now live. Their neighborhood was largely spared, but everyone, including my parents, were now in the streets, fearful of the powerful aftershocks. The rumors were circulating about an impending earthquake that would be even more powerful. My father seemed traumatized. I can only imagine what my mother felt -- who suffers from late Parkinson's disease and is mostly bed-ridden.

The young in Nepal have always left their homes to pursue opportunities elsewhere. I grew up in a tiny hamlet in Gorkha -- Jaubari -- a few miles from the devastated village of Barpak, which is the epicenter of the earthquake. Barpak, then as now, was mostly inhabited by Ghales. It was the birth place of Jamdar Gaje Ghale, a textbook Nepali hero who had received the Victoria Cross for his bravery during the Second World War. Many of my classmates in my local school were Ghales from Barpak. But few of them graduated from high school as most were recruited as Gurkhas in the British or the Indian army. Many from my own village -- who were of a different ethnic group and were not considered by the army recruiters -- had to make do with some menial jobs in India. 

This trend was accelerated during the Maoist insurgency that started in the mid '90s. A weak democratic polity had unleashed expectations to the populace, but the politicians -- then as now  -- were bickering among themselves to divide the spoils. There were few opportunities for the young and little hope for the future. Many joined the Maoists to realize a communist utopia -- initiating a civil war that was to last over a decade and ravaged the whole society. Those who did not, left to work in the factories of Malaysia or the deserts of Gulf States. The better educated ones made it to North America and Europe. 

This huge Nepali diaspora is now observing the unfolding tragedy in Nepal with pain and dread.  The images and video are heartbreaking to watch. Along with the loss of life, the structures that were part of one's life -- the temples and the monuments -- all lay in ruins. Many in the diaspora have lost their relatives or are listed as missing. It is hard enough to communicate as power lines are down and telephone/cell phone service is erratic. And the social media can be a double edged sword. It provides a much-needed community, but also can be a source of rumors and half truths. Already there are reports of looting and arson. Fears of an epidemic could very well prove to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Sometimes, it is almost as if one is reading a chapter of Saragamo's dystopian Blindness.

Nepali diaspora has been trying to help. Huge sums of money and resources are being raised in different parts of the world. Within communities, there are also arguments as to how  they are to be disbursed. But the pain is still palpable and a sense of helplessness pervades.

So hard to separate. The big mirror that reflects all of our warts and cross hairs right back to us. And one of the most charming soothsayers of the human heart, Eric Rohmer, is being showcased at Lincoln Center.

Each of the Comedies & Proverb films begins with a proverb and in The Aviator's Wife ""it is impossible to think of nothing."" That implies that the film has passive action but the real activity is in the obsessive thinking of its characters.

I had seen all of Monsieur Rohmer's Comedies except Aviator's Wife. This is a story that shows how the art of rejection can create more rejection; how a little information can burn like a hole in a pocket until all the data is discovered, and usually the original premise is wrong; and how playing with the emotion of another is such a sweet, albeit unconscious power trip.

Like all of Rohmer's films, the acting is natural, the scenes go on as if you're really sitting in a conversation with a friend, witnessing the perils are of the heart. Girl (Marie Riviere) gets upsetting news, boyfriend (Phillippe Marlaud) gets upsetting sighting and the story begins. What is particularly striking in this 1981 film is the exquisite absence of cell phones. The story couldn't be told in a cell phone world. There is nothing as mysterious with a text (ask Anthony Weiner) as a letter.  Little notes left in little slots can open up a story, with more possibilities for interpretation than even the most venal email... less is certainly more in the case of this film and the meaning of whether to hand deliver a card or gain distance with a stamp is beautifully executed by Rohmer. The film predates Charley Hebdo -- notice the black and white keffiyah Riviere wears jauntily around her throat and the lovely young Anne-Laure Meury plays with her prey by joking about her Muslim Black street sweeper boyfriend.

The politics and technology have certainly changed, but not the dance between men and women. Rohmer knows well the steps; the missteps are endearing. 

The theme song is sung by Arrielle Dombasle, stunning as Pauline at the Beach (also playing) and now the wife of philosopher Bernard Henri-Levy.

As of Monday morning, the lava's surface was within seven feet of the lake's rim, the highest it's been since the current eruption began in 2008. 

""Magma is rising up into the lava lake from a magma chamber a mile or so beneath the summit of Kilauea volcano,"" research geologist Matthew Patrick told The Huffington Post. According to Patrick, an overflow is a definite possibility because Kilauea has been consistently inflating for the past week, meaning that magma keeps flowing into the lake from an underground chamber below.

In the event of an overflow, the lava would stay within Halemaumau Crater, the larger crater in the floor of which the lava lake sits, so it would pose no safety threat. But visitors to Volcanoes National Park would get quite a display. 

Typically, the lava surface is 100 to 200 feet below the rim of the crater lake and therefore can't be seen from the public viewing area around the volcano. Since the lava has risen, Patrick said, ""its incandescent cracks and often vigorous spattering"" can easily be seen from the overlook. An overflow would ""likely provide an impressive scene for park visitors.""

While this is a notable development in the current eruption, it's not particularly unusual in the history of Kilauea, Patrick said. ""In the 1800s and early 1900s, there was nearly continuous lava lake activity for about 100 years, and oftentimes that lava was spilling out of Halemaumau Crater,"" he explained.

As exciting as an overflow sounds, it is also possible Kilauea will abruptly deflate, Patrick said, bringing the lava's surface back down to typical levels.

In the meantime, we can all enjoy a better view into the lava lake:

Termed #momishere and #nofilter30,  Sprout is encouraging mothers everywhere to simply stop taking pictures of just their kids, and jump in the picture with them. It's a movement to inspire moms to embrace the imperfect, and capture ourselves with our children living everyday regular lives, even if they are messy, as real life can be. Leading the campaign again this year is actress and blogger Michele Lepe better known as Nina, on Sprout's The Good Night Show. When asked why she got involved with such a campaign, Lepe didn't hesitate to share her excitement for a movement  that has the ability to empower women as  mothers. ""It's all about supporting and inspiring mothers to come out from behind the camera and be in the picture."" Lepe said. 

And she is not alone. A recent viral post about Moms Getting in the Picture drew  hundreds of thousand of readers,  some with very emotional reactions. Many were commenting that they are never in real pictures anymore, and often are not comfortable with their appearance, thus hesitating to get in front of the camera. The #momishere and #nofilter30 campaign seeks to encourage mothers to let go of their insecurities, and embrace everyday parenting moments with their kids and snap a picture while doing so.   ""This is a wonderful opportunity to not only make memories together, but to capture them in photos for my kids."" Lepe said.  As for moms who shy away, she says, ""Your children love you unconditionally. They don't see your flaws. They see love. It's important for them to not see us self-conscious."" 

Lepe has been snapping pictures of her and her children since the#momishere campaign started on April 11, and will continue to do so  everyday until it ends on Mother's Day, May 11. The 30 day challenge is still well under way, and Sprout is even giving away prizes to those who participate. Moms only need to share their daily, candid photos on Instagram and Twitter with the #momishere or #nofilter hashtag to be entered. 

""This has motivated me to not only capture more pictures of myself with my children, but also actually upload my pictures to be made into prints, and possibly photo books that my children can enjoy for years to come."" Lepe continues, ""It's not about perfection and posing. It's about real moments, and  I want those memories for my kids.""

Johns Hopkins University, which employs more than 21,000 workers in the city, canceled all classes and events on Tuesday and asked all nonessential employees to stay home. 

“This is out of an abundance of caution and uncertainty about what conditions will be like today,” Dennis O’Shea, a spokesman for the college, told The Huffington Post. 

He said the school had not yet planned any outreach programs for after the unrest subsided, but that some student groups were in the city helping to clean up debris from the riots Monday.

John Hopkins Hospital and Health Systems, another top employer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but O'Shea said most clinical professionals were still at work on Tuesday afternoon.

Constellation Energy, with its roughly 3,100-strong workforce in Baltimore, asked employees to work from home.

“In an effort to ensure employee safety, Constellation asked its Baltimore-based employees to work remotely,” Christina Pratt, a spokesman, told HuffPost in an email. “We will continue to monitor the situation in the days ahead and stay in regular contact with our employees.”

The city’s two largest financial companies, money manager T. Rowe Price Group and the investment bank Legg Mason, also asked employees to work from home. T. Rowe Price sent employees home early on Monday as violence broke out across the city.

“As always, the safety and security of our associates remains our paramount concern,” said spokesman Edward Giltenan, adding that T. Rowe Price employs 1,262 people at its evacuated downtown Baltimore headquarters. “We have maintained communications with our associates during this time and will continue to do so as circumstances warrant. We will also continue to monitor the situation in consultation with local authorities to determine what additional steps, if any, may need to be taken.”

Bank of America, which maintains a sizable outpost in Baltimore, said it was also focusing on safety.  

""We’ve taken appropriate steps to ensure the safety of our customers and employees, which includes closing branches and administrative facilities in the affected area,"" spokeswoman Nicole Nastacie told HuffPost. 

Morgan Stanley also has operations in the city, but a representative did not return calls requesting comment. The University System of Maryland, the University of Maryland and Loyola University did not immediately respond, either.

The rioting Monday in West Baltimore marked the most violent clashes between citizens and police in the United States since the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, over the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown last August.  -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

I can offer up words based on my own experiences, but I can't know with any certainty that what worked for me might work for both of you. Many who offer up advice forget this crucial fact, so be picky about what advice you choose to listen to. Here's my best attempt at words of wisdom.

Nothing really prepares you for the shock and awe of an infant. Life begins to exist before and after child. You are the anchor between the two, less of who you used to be, but somehow more too. When my daughter was born 6 and a half years ago, I became a different human being upon her arrival. No longer just a daughter, sister, or partner, but a mother. I was responsible for the life of another person; I was terrified. As I held her close, I marveled at her fragility and resilience. How could she ever depend on me since I could barely depend on myself?, I thought. The trials of nursing, sleeplessness, and constant care made me the mother that I didn't imagine I could be. She needed me, so I was there. I did the best I could, and I still do. That is enough. Never forget that. Ignore those who suggest otherwise.

My daughter was part me and part my husband. I catch glimpses of him in her, and I see my own qualities in her toothy grin, her rigid body language when she's frustrated, and in her tears over the casual cruelties of life. Yet, she's not me or him. She's fully her own person; both of your lovely children will be too. Our children are not us, despite all the resemblances. We must let them be who they are. Babies appear as potential for every parent's dreams, but toddlers and children show us that our dreams don't rest easy with reality. We love them intensely as we, and they, try to figure out their place in the world. But, we shouldn't bend them to fit what we want them to be. They're resilient, but they trust us too much. They can break. Help your child become the best version of his/her self; that's both the hardest and easiest thing to do. It is hard since we have to let go of our aspirations for them, and yet, it is easy because we follow their lead. Moment by moment, children teach us that reality is not under our firm control. It never was.

When my son arrived 1 and a half years ago, I feared that I couldn't love him as much as I loved his sister. Yet, I do. I was transformed again. No longer was I defined by one, but two small human beings, who knew how to take before they ever learned how to give. I felt that I was crumbling under the weight of their burden. They took. I gave and gave and gave. What if, I wondered, there was nothing left of me? What if I sacrificed too much? What if I didn't give enough? What would happen to them and me?

Just when I thought I couldn't possibly be a mother of two, that I was unprepared and unfit, my children loved me back just as fiercely as I loved them. Their love bolstered me in ways that I hope my love supported them. As my son learned to smile, to laugh, to sit up, to crawl, to talk, to walk, and to run, he also learned to give strong hugs and snotty kisses. My daughter randomly shouts that she loves me as she rushes to school or to play. 

My children are two of the best things that have ever happened to me. They made me into a better person than I was. They bring me joy that I've never experienced before. When they smile and laugh, I do too. I can't help myself. I've never loved anyone the way I do these two.

Being a mother is also most arduous task I've encountered. In those first months after my daughter and son were born, I realized that I had never really known what it meant to be exhausted. I was worn down and spent. Parenting was hard. This is why I hesitated to give you advice, the daughter of my friend and my youngest sister. The particularity of the hard is what gets us. What might have been hard (seemingly impossible) for me might be easy for you. My burdens will be different from yours. I can't know what you'll face, but I do know you can face it. 

I'll let you in on a little secret. All mothers feel like they've failed their children, even if we don't say so aloud. Thinking you've failed, however, is not the same as failure. After a trying day, I recite all my failings. What happened in this terrible day that my children will later commiserate about as adults? I let it all out, and then, I plan to be better the next day. 

Sweethearts, there are days in which you'll feel like a failure too. You aren't. Your kids will be lucky to have you for your strengths as well as your flaws. Parents are our first cautionary tales. It can't be helped. ""Don't be me,"" was my fervent prayer in the early years of my daughter's life. I wanted her to be her own person minus my flaws. Now as watch these two children grow, I whisper, ""Be better than me."" They are better, but they also made me better. This is more than I ever could have hoped for. It is more than I ever dared to ask. 

This is what I wish for the both of you too.

Yellow cheese. We wouldn't go as far as saying the word ""Velveeta,"" but you get the idea. Now take that semi-dairy product and imagine every possible combination of it with corn tortillas, cumin, chile powder, beef and refried beans. That's Tex-Mex.

That makes it sound simple, but when both Tex-Mex and Mexican restaurants offer dishes like queso, enchiladas and fajitas, the menu can get a bit muddled. That's why we've put together this handy-dandy guide to the 10 dishes that define Texas cuisine at its most essential. So grab some Alka-Seltzer, sip on a frozen margarita and order one of these 10 monstrosities.

(A quick note: while hot places like Javelina in New York City tout a Tex-Mex menu, we're recommending the classic spots in the Lone Star State to get your fix.)

Cheese Enchiladas With Chile Con Carne

We're not sure what's more important here: the cheese or the chile con carne. Both play a crucial role in what we consider the most important Tex-Mex dish. Corn tortillas wrap around ooey-gooey yellow cheese and are doused with more than a healthy amount of chile con carne (basically ground beef stew with plenty of cumin and chile powder), then sprinkled with grated yellow cheese and chopped white onions. Usually served with a side of refried pinto beans (made with lard, of course) and Spanish rice, it's hard to tell if the grease puddles are coming from the cheese, the beans or your heart.

Queso

Queso means ""cheese"" in Spanish, but in Tex-Mex, it means a specific kind of cheese. You guessed it: the yellow variety. Here it's melted into drippy form and served in a bowl with tortilla chips for dipping, usually sided with salsa and sometimes with guacamole. At its most basic, queso can be Velveeta microwaved with Rotel tomatoes, but done right, it's an art form.

Puffy Tacos

A San Antonio specialty, puffy tacos bring fluffiness (you might even say puffiness) to corn tortillas that are usually pretty flat. Made from masa that is deep-fried until air pockets form, they're filled with everything from ground beef to shredded chicken, with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, guacamole, cheese and salsa. Hold them like a taco and eat them delicately, as they tend to fall apart.
Where to Try: Ray's Drive Inn and Pete's Tako House, both in San Antonio

Flautas

Think of flautas as enchiladas' fried cousin (served naked, they're sometimes called taquitos in the fast-food world). Beef, chicken or refried beans are wrapped tightly in corn tortillas, and then the entire piece is deep-fried into one crispy casing. A plate comes with at least three of these babies smothered in green or red sauce, queso, sour cream and guacamole, with rice and refried beans, of course.
Where to Try: Mattito's in Dallas and Matt's El Rancho in Austin

821d389725e9a835f6c876ea5cb711dc,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/28/baltimore-gangs-cops-freddie-gray_n_7162350.html,Baltimore Gang Members Say They Never Formed Truce To Hurt Cops,"Rival Baltimore gang members came together Monday night to say that they never formed a truce to harm city police officers in revenge for the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray, who died last week after being injured in police custody.

“We want the people of Baltimore City to know that the image they are trying to portray of gangs in Baltimore  -- the [Black Guerilla Family], the Bloods, the Crips -- we did not make that truce to harm cops,” a man who identified as a member of the Bloods gang told Baltimore’s NBC affiliate station WBAL 11. 

He was joined by about eight other self-identified gang members from the Bloods and Crips. “We did not come together to harm cops,"" he said. ""We’re not about to allow y’all to paint this picture of us.” 

On Monday morning -- before protests and violent riots erupted across the city following Gray's funeral -- the Baltimore Police Department said it had uncovered a “credible threat” that members of the three gangs, among other groups, were conspiring to “take out” police officers. 

“We have soldiers out here right now,” the Blood member told WBAL 11. “We dirty. We dirty. They threw bombs at us for trying to stop what’s going on right now. Y’all not about to do that to us.” 

“So your game plan tonight has been to stop the violence?” asked reporter Deborah Weiner. 

“To stop what’s going on,” the Blood member confirmed. “We just want justice for Freddie Gray. We believe in that.” 

Police Monday fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters, some of whom had been seen throwing rocks and bricks at officers wearing riot gear. Multiple stores were also pictured being looted. Fifteen buildings were set aflame, as were nearly 150 vehicles, and about 200 people were arrested, the mayor's office told The Associated Press. 

Fifteen officers were injured, two of whom were hospitalized, police said. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake issued a curfew, and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency, activating 5,000 members of the National Guard. 

Gray died on April 19 after suffering serious spinal injuries while in police custody. A video from a bystander showed Gray being dragged into a police van. The six Baltimore police officers involved in the arrest have been suspended.

“It makes us look real bad, and it’s backing up what they are saying about us,” the Blood member said of the violence Monday. “They are saying we are animals, and we acting like savages out here. But I also don’t agree with what’s going on, but I understand what’s going on. I understand why people are mad, but we have to handle things another way.” 

“Stop believing everything you hear in the media,” he added. “If you were not at the protest on the day we protested for Freddie, you don’t know what actually happened. They did not tell y’all that when we walked past the eateries downtown, people threw beers at us. People called us names.” 

“People called us 'niggers,'” another man chimed in.

A photo posted to Facebook on Saturday showed members of the Bloods and Crips posing together during a protest march from West Baltimore to City Hall. Members of the Nation of Islam claimed to have brokered the unlikely alliance. 



“Why don’t they paint this picture in a positive way?” another gang member asked WBAL. “When a group of 30 Bloods walks up on a group of 30 Crips and everyone salutes and shakes hands and hugs and starts to take pictures. But then everyone says, ‘Oh no, they’re uniting to kill cops.’” 

One of the Blood members added that they can’t “control every gang in the city and state.” 

“I estimate that we were 30 people strong, out of the thousand of people who were down there,” he continued. “You mean to tell me you point the finger at us because we have colors on. That is not what we stand for. Justice for Freddie Gray. Justice.” 

“Justice,” the other men repeated. 

The Baltimore Police department told The Huffington Post on Tuesday that it had no update on the “credible threat” it uncovered against law enforcement.

b573e80ed7c62e1b6ef5966b3b216fe1,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-clear/smart-people-should-creat_b_7118604.html,Smart People Should Create Things,"It was 1974 and Art Fry was spending his weekend singing for the local church choir. On this particular Sunday, Fry was dealing with a relatively boring problem: He couldn't keep his bookmarks in place.

In order to find hymns quickly, Fry would stick little pieces of paper between the pages like bookmarks. The only problem was that every time he stood up, the pieces of paper would slide down deep between the pages or fall out of the book completely. Annoyed by the constant placing and replacing of his bookmarks, Fry started daydreaming about a better solution.

""It was during the sermon,"" Fry said, ""that I first thought, 'What I really need is a little bookmark that will stick to the paper but will not tear the paper when I remove it.'"" [1]

With this idea in mind, Fry went back to work the next week and began developing a solution to his bookmark problem. As luck would have it, Fry happened to be working at the perfect company. He was an employee at 3M and one of his co-workers, Spencer Silver, was an adhesives specialist.

Over the next few months, Fry and Silver developed a piece of paper that would stick to a page, but could be easily removed and reapplied over and over. Eventually, this little project became one of the best-selling office supplies of all-time: the Post-it Note.

Today, 3M sells Post-it Notes in over 100 countries worldwide. You can find them at libraries and schools, in offices and boardrooms, and scattered around nearly every workspace in between.

What can we learn from the story of Art Fry? And is there something we can take away from this to make our lives and the world better?

Create Something Small

Art Fry wasn't trying to create a best-selling office supply product. In the beginning, Fry was simply trying to design a better bookmark for his choir hymnal. He was just trying to create something small.

For a long time, I thought that if I wasn't working on something incredible, then it wasn't of much value. But gradually I discovered the truth: The most important thing isn't to create something world-changing, but simply to create. You don't have to build something famous to build something meaningful.

And this brings us to the most important lesson we can learn from Art Fry and his Post-it Notes: when the world presents you with something interesting or frustrating or curious, choose to do something about it. Choose to be a creator.

In other words, the world needs smart people to build things. We need employees who invent things, entrepreneurs who create things, and freelancers who design things. We need secretaries who make jewelry as a side project and stay-at-home dads who write amazing novels. We need more leaders, not more followers. We need more creators, not more consumers.

And perhaps the most important thing to realize is that we not only need to create for each other, but for ourselves as well. Creating something is the perfect way to avoid wasting the precious moments that we have been given. To contribute, to create, to chip in to the world around you and to add your line to the world's story -- that is a life well lived.

What will you create today?

Jerry Brown Orders Aggressive Greenhouse Gas Cuts By 2030,"April 29 (Reuters) - California Governor Jerry Brown issued  an executive order on Wednesday to cut the state's greenhouse  gas emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, his  office said in a statement.                The new target is ""the most aggressive benchmark enacted by  any government in North America to reduce dangerous carbon  emissions,"" the governor's office said.                ""With this order, California sets a very high bar for itself  and other states and nations, but it's one that must be reached  - for this generation and generations to come,"" Brown said in a  statement.                The new target would put California on track to meet a  longer-term goal of achieving an 80 percent cut below the same  benchmark by 2050.                The state is ""on track"" to meet or beat its current target  to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent below 1990  levels by 2020, the governor's office said.                Brown's announcement comes as the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) works to finalize by July or August the  first mandatory rules to limit carbon emissions from the  country's existing power plants.                Under the current EPA proposal, California is required to  cut the rate at which its power plants emit carbon dioxide by 23  percent by 2030.                The state already has in place an economy-wide cap-and-trade  system that will help it meet state and federal emissions-cut  targets.                States will need to submit plans next year to the EPA  detailing how they will meet EPA-assigned emissions targets.                Brown also said in the statement that California's new  target is in line with those of some leading international  governments ahead of United Nations climate change negotiations   that will take place for two weeks in Paris, starting Nov. 30.                ""California's announcement is a realization and a  determination that will gladly resonate with other inspiring  actions within the United States and around the globe,""  Christiana Figueres, the UN's climate change chief, said in a  statement.

You may not need a whole entire neighborhood but another set of hands would be nice.

Don't get me wrong, I love my children. I feel like I have to put that out there so no one calls the Department of Health and Human Services on me. I enjoy my time with them and every day they teach me, yes me, something new about life, love and most importantly empathy. They are truly wonderful children.

That said...

I'm tired and thinking my own mother didn't know how good she had it. She raised my brother and I on her own but we also lived with my grandparents. She had backup care if she had to go to work and we were off, shoot, she had back up care if she wanted to watch General Hospital. Me, not so much. My children's grandparents are already gone and I live far away from any familial help so that means, it's all on me and let me tell you, all on me sucks.



I long for the days that will keep all of us at home and them in bed an extra hour later so I can do things like write this blog or watch a rerun of Gilmore Girls. The daily monotony of getting them all up, doing school drop offs, going to work, picking everyone up, making dinner and giving baths has gotten old.

It got old, real quick.

No one tells you how awful it is when you're sick, the kids are sick and you just have to pull on your big girl panties and make it work. It would have been wonderful to just pull the covers over my head and sleep off the flu but I couldn't. I never knew my body could function on 0 hours of sleep and 103 fever but it can. It's amazing what sheer will can do. We may have lived on Chinese take out for three days but at least it had veggies in it. I am now a firm believer that Won Ton soup can cure anything.

Life was nice when there was another set of hands around. Someone to do things when you were tired or just plain didn't feel like it. It was nice to have someone to cook dinner when you were out of ideas and didn't want take out again. With someone else helping out, it left me free time to plan fun things to do with the kids. Now, I'd just be happy to not have to struggle for 30 minutes with a jar of spaghetti sauce. I would start an upper body workout to have more strength but I seriously don't have the time.

I tell myself, I do it all for them. I say this to myself at night when I'm alone snuggled up next to my boyfriend pillow. The kids are happy and that's all that matters. They've come to understand that Mom has to work so we can have money to buy things and pay for our house. It still doesn't make the decision to miss yet another field trip any easier. When vacation days are far and few between, I do what I have to do. Maybe one day my circumstances will change and I'll have something more than Mom Guilt to keep me warm at night. Until that day comes, I'll keep putting on my big girl panties and slugging along. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

cdaceabefb0f6cfb2abbc2a7c878dda7,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kurt-ellenberger/can-a-musicologist-make-a_b_7164374.html,Ted Gioia's Bar Talk: Can a Musicologist Make Club Owners Pay More?,"Ted Gioia's recent article entitled ""Can Club Owners Make Musicians Play for Free?"" is, like many of his other posts, quickly going viral on social media with the jazz community. The premise is tailor-made for the times -- evil bar owners (corporate elite), poor musicians (downtrodden proletariat), government (selfless saviors) via the courts will ride in on a white horse to protect the worker from the jaws of the oppressor (after all, ""profit"" is defined as ""unpaid wages"" and it's time for those unpaid wages to be paid!).

I'm an admirer of Gioia's work -- he is an outstanding writer and intellectual and his posts are thoughtful, well-reasoned, and informed by his impressive knowledge of music and history, but this essay is a departure from his usual form. It plays well on Facebook, as this soft marxism always does, but it just doesn't hold up to much critical scrutiny.

To begin with, the premise in the title, as phrased, is difficult to swallow -- can club owners make jazz musicians play for free? (While Gioia doesn't specify the genre, he's a jazz writer, and there's a jazz band pictured, so I assume that jazz is the genre in question.) Unless involuntary servitude has been somehow re-instituted for jazz musicians playing clubs, I'm not sure how any club owner is forcing any musician to play for free. No musician is ""made"" to play for free -- if any are doing so, they are doing it of their own free will (no pun intended), likely because they have decided that their desire to perform and the exposure that they hope to get from these performances are a higher value than the meager fee they might receive from the club. As someone who used to actually play these clubs for a living, I know this scene very well, and I've seen it deteriorate over the last 25 years, so I am not unfamiliar with the supposed ""unfairness"" of the live music scene. It is not, however, unfair -- the argument of many musicians and artists rests on the assumption that one should be paid according to how much work and effort and training it took to attain a professional level of proficient. While this is true for a surgeon or an engineer, it is not true for most musicians. This argument ignores the fact that high levels of complexity and difficulty are not universally held criteria for enjoying music. Very few people care about how difficult it was to learn the instrument or the piece, what they care about is whether they enjoy the music that is being presented. In addition, live music of all kinds, unfortunately, no longer has the appeal that it did 30 years ago, in the days before we had a universe of distractions and entertainment instantaneously available.

Here is a quote from Gioia's essay:

And many performers, desperate for an opportunity to showcase their skills, agree to do just that. I don't blame the musicians. In most instances, they struggle to survive and have to grasp at any opportunity, however meager. But the owners are a different matter. 

So, musicians are desperate for a showcase, and therefore, the club owners must subsidize their desperation? In reality, the club owner is simply responding to whatever attracts the clientele and unfortunately, live music is simply not that attractive or special anymore, hence it does not regularly generate enough income to cover the expense of a band (unless, of course, that band has a large following that will show up regularly and spend money copiously). A musician's desire to make a living as a performer does not automatically require the rest of society to like it and pay for it. It's as simple as that.

How many club owners would ask Lady Gaga or Keith Jarrett to play for free? None. Why? Because both artists can generate ticket sales and bar receipts that exceed their fees -- a mutually beneficial arrangement for both the club owner and the artist, which is how it must be. Gioia somewhat flippantly says that ""the owners are a different matter."" Yes, the owners are a different matter. The restaurant/bar business is a tough slog -- net profit margins range (on average) from 2-6 percent which means that the club owner does not have a pile of cash sitting around to pay the band, unless, of course, the band can generate enough extra income, at a minimum, to pay for itself in full. For most groups, especially in the jazz genre, it is impossible to do this on a regular basis. On top of that difficult profit margin, keep in mind that approximately 60 percent of these businesses fail in the first three years. Gioia and many jazz musicians are just confused -- they think that by virtue of opening a bar or restaurant, the owner automatically becomes a philanthropist with a registered 501(c)(3).

As if all of that class warfare boilerplate weren't enough, it gets worse. The essay continues by making several comparisons between musicians and strippers. In each case, Gioia ignores the obvious difference: strippers bring in customers, customers who spend enough money to pay for all of the expenses. This is why unionization hasn't been very successful with jazz musicians working clubs and casual gigs -- in order to negotiate with management, the employee needs some leverage, which usually means withholding the services without which the business could not run. In the case of the strippers, we can be quite sure that the clientele at those establishments is not going there for the ambience, the excellent mixologist behind the bar, or the fine dining being served at the midnight buffet -- they are there to see naked women, and if those women aren't there, there won't be any income. The same cannot be said about jazz groups playing restaurants. They have nothing to bargain with because they are not the reason that most people are going to the establishment in the first place. Even with more popular groups that might have the ability to draw a crowd, the normal negotiations regarding salary must take place -- you won't be paid what you think you're worth, you'll be paid according to the value you can add to the business.

Gioia then continues with a somewhat tortured legal inquiry into whether musicians playing clubs are actually ""employees"" or whether they are independent contractors. If they're employees, he asks, then why aren't they getting minimum wage? (As if minimum wage for four hours on Friday and Saturday night is going to make a difference anyway.) In any case, when your position relies on a discussion about musicians and strippers and minimum wage and the definition of an independent contractor, you've lost the argument -- the only people this will be convincing to are the ones who want the clubs to pay them more, but the rest will recognize it for what it is; a desperate attempt to find a rationale for regulation to artificially increase the wages of a special interest group, namely, jazz musicians playing bars and restaurants.

This issue has been around for a long time. I noticed it first in the late 1980s, when rock bands in major centers started paying clubs to play, but today it has gotten even worse; some jazz musicians are actually paying the audience to attend their gigs!  If Gioia has his way and the government gets involved (which is unlikely), the end result will be less work and less opportunity for jazz musicians. As I've written about previously, there has been similar agitation in recent years by big city unions trying to shake down the clubs, but it has not achieved anything and neither will this attempt. Club owners will not and cannot pay for music unless that music adds enough income to pay for itself. Any attempt to squeeze that meager profit margin further will simply result in less live music, paid or otherwise, in the clubs and restaurants across the country.

I ask that question a lot to people who come to me for health coaching. They usually look at me pretty strangely, forcing me to repeat the question and wait for an answer. 

I'll hear any number of responses.

""Because I'm hungry.""
""Because I'm bored.""
""Because I'm celebrating""
""Because food tastes good.""
""Because I'm fueling my body.""

The last one is really the one that I'm interested in, but it's the one I hear the least.

We eat for all kinds of reasons, but for some of us, it's not the right reasons. Food is everywhere. Food is how we celebrate, how we connect, how we mourn and even how we pass the time. Food does taste good, and it should taste good.

I'm not suggesting that anyone stop having coffee at their coffee dates, stop taking the kids out for ice cream (once in a while) or stop having cake at their birthday parties; but let's not forget the main reason why we should be eating. 

Food is fuel for our bodies. When we are properly fueled we can do all the things that we need and want to do. Food gives us energy to do our jobs, play with the kids, go out and run, walk or ride our bikes. Most people I talk to are more concerned about the kind of gas they put in their cars than they are with the type of food they put in their bodies.

We are filled up with greasy, fatty, overly-processed foods that may taste good going down, but do nothing for our systems once they are digested. People come to me wondering why they are sluggish, gassy and irritable. They wonder why their skin is breaking out, why they have headaches all the time, and why they are out of breath walking to the mailbox. 

Many people come to me feeling like crap after years of eating crap yet somehow have never made the connection that what they are eating could be the root of their problems.

When we eat for reasons other than fuel, it can sometimes lead to unhealthy overeating. This happens because when we are eating to fill a void other than hunger, the food never actually fills the void.

I was a binge eater for a very long time, and it only got worse after I got divorced and started living alone. Suddenly, there was no one there to ""police"" my eating, no one there to see how many slices of pizza I had eaten, or how quickly I had emptied a box of cookies.

I was eating all the wrong things and for all the wrong reasons. Eating was no longer about being hungry, it was about entertainment, it was about enjoyment, but most of all, it was about distraction. When I was eating, I was focused on the food and that allowed me to stop focusing on how lonely or unhappy I was feeling. 

When I started asking myself the question, ""why are you eating,"" I started to come to terms with my food issues. Now, if the answer to that question is anything other than, ""because I'm hungry,"" I stop myself. 

This is not to say that I never have a treat from time-to-time, just because it tastes good; I still do that, and I encourage you to do it too. But most of the time when I eat now it's because I'm hungry and I need to fuel my body. 

If I'm going out for a run, I know I need a certain type of fuel to help me with that activity. I fuel up for a day of work, or to ride my bike, even sitting down to relax at the end of a long day requires its own type of fuel. 

Each time you consume food you are making a decision about what and how much your will eat. Making the decision to eat to healthy and fuel your body with quality foods will pay dividends. With each bite of food you can properly care for your body and protect your health and vitality.

The next time you sit down to eat, ask yourself the question of why you are eating, and then, pay attention to the answer. If you're hungry and need to refuel, eat something. If you're bored and need entertainment, watch a movie.

Austin, Texas will play host to the first annual Austin International Drag Festival May 1-3, bringing together queens from across the spectrum of drag performance and all around the world. From ""RuPaul's Drag Race"" icons like Adore Delano and Pandora Boxx to legends like Lady Bunny and Coco Peru, it's sure to be a debaucherous and entertaining weekend for the thousands of people expected to attend.



The three-day festival is being staged on by Austin International Drag Foundation Inc., a 100% volunteer-run 501c3 charity. President and CEO of Austin International Drag Foundation Inc., Jamie Steward Bancroft, explained in an email to The Huffington Post:
Every genre of drag and gender expression will be represented including kings, queens, faux queens, pageant queens, punk rock queens, draglesque performers and experimental acts. Behind it all is the nonprofit... whose mission is the education, support and promotion of drag artists. All profit made from this inaugural festival will help pay for future events, as well as provide funding to like-minded charities that provide social services for the drag artist and transgender communities.

We'll be in Austin this weekend covering all of the acton. Interested in attending?

8e75a42b1cbaf217c023ca06d30a314d,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brad-reid/due-diligence-trust-but-v_b_7171228.html,Due Diligence: Trust But Verify,"Due diligence is the investigation that a reasonable person would make in good faith to ascertain the facts in a situation or to determine the truthfulness of assertions. Depending upon the circumstances and issues at stake, this inquiry may be quite broad and detailed. Due diligence is a legal principle in numerous areas including, for example, information security, philanthropy, corporate finance, business transactions generally, and personal relationships. 

If a court determines that an individual or entity failed to exercise due diligence, the court will typically not grant this person relief.  This is especially evident when the true facts could have been determined, or a transaction's accompanying signed agreement states that neither party is relying upon the representations of the other.  While ""lack of reliance"" language may seem like harmless legalese boilerplate, the implications may be quite serious. Always involve experienced professionals in negotiating and understanding your agreements.

A recent decision by an Appellate Court in Illinois involved an alleged difference between $17.5 million paid and a $49.8 million value due to a lack of due diligence by the seller of a one-third interest in a business to the other co-owners (Willis Capital LLC v. Belvedere Trading LLC). In brief and simplified summary, the one-third selling owner was a firm wholly owned by an individual.  In the course of negotiating the sale, the seller requested an appraisal but the prospective buyers replied ""that an appraisal was not necessary because they did not want to sell their interests in the company.""  The buyers did not reveal that they had previously commissioned an appraisal of the seller's interest in the firm, but had asked that a written report not be prepared. After three hours of negotiations, a selling price of $17.5 million was reached, representing the seller's capital account balance plus one year's share of trading profits.

The resulting written sales agreement contained a section entitled ""Mutual General Releases."" This section released all claims that the parties might have against each other, and stated ""that each party fully assumes the risk that the facts or law may be other than they believe."" Furthermore, the parties agreed ""that they are not relying upon any promise, inducement, representation, statement, disclosure or duty of disclosure of the other party in entering into this agreement."" They agreed that they were not fiduciaries in the negotiations and that ""this agreement supersedes all prior written and verbal agreements and understandings.""  Additionally, if either party sued to enforce the agreement, ""the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable legal fees and expenses.""

Approximately three years after the sale, the seller discovered the existence of the undisclosed appraisal. The seller then obtained an independent appraisal, resulting in the allegation of an approximately $32 million underpayment and this resulting litigation.

The selling plaintiff not only lost the lawsuit but the trial court awarded the purchasing defendants $172,391.75 in fees and costs.

The Appellate Court upheld the trial court's judgment in favor of the defendants, noting that the seller had sufficient information at the time of the agreement to determine the correct value but failed to exercise due diligence. The Appellate Court wrote: ""We understand Willis's [the seller's] feeling of being cheated by its former partners and the assertion that it was lulled into accepting a grossly reduced amount for its share of the Belvedere company."" However, ""because of its business experience Willis knew, or should have known, that an appraisal of the value of the company was necessary prior to selling its shares, given the magnitude of the transaction."" ""Empathy aside,...we cannot extricate Willis from the natural consequences of a bad business decision.""  The only consolation that the Appellate Court offered the seller was a reversal of the fees and costs since the litigation was technically not concerned with enforcing the sales agreement.

The necessity of due diligence is emphasized in numerous cases. While fraud or active concealment of the truth may overcome an asserted lack of due diligence, it is incumbent on a plaintiff to show that her or his active quest for truth was prevented or interfered with by the defendant. Occasionally a court will consider the differences in education, experience, or sophistication between the parties. However, ""trust but verify"" is a good motto in the business environment as well as in intimate personal relationships. Always involve experienced professionals in your specific business and personal transactions. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

I'm Miriam Ava, founder of ColorsofGratitude.com and ambassador of good taste. I love sharing messages that matter, one Dispatch at a time. Enjoy all Dispatches here.

What's is like to live with intent? According to Mallika Chopra -- mom, author, entrepreneur -- living with intent comes ""from our soul."" Her new book Living with Intent: My Somewhat Messy Journey to Purpose, Peace, and Joy outlines a ""conscious journey to tap into the wisdom I grew up in."" Expect to find nuggets of knowledge from friends and family such as Eckhart Tolle, Marianne Williamson, Arianna Huffington, Andrew Weil, Dan Siegel, and dad Deepak Chopra, of course.

The Chopra home hadn't always been the hub of peace, calm, and meditation; in fact, as Chopra shares, it was only when her father stumbled upon a meditation center that things started to shift. Soon the whole family began to enjoy the benefits of inner stillness and focus. One of the great gifts of her childhood, Chopra says, was that she and her brother learned early on to ask for love, joy, and peace. And meditation is one avenue to create those states.

It was only fitting that Chopra's book party at ABC Home opened with a meditation led by host Gabby Bernstein. With the intent to be cracked wide open the night unfolded.



""This book is years in the making,"" Chopra shares. Here's the gist of it:

I: incubate; tap into the silence
N: notice; notice the opportunities
T: trust your intuition; trust that the universe will take care of the details
E: express; take ownership
N: nurture; relationships; ask for help; let go of guilt
T: take action; movement; momentum

The acronym encapsulates the wisdom she's gained along the way as the subtitle indicates: ""My somewhat messy journey... it's a winding path. It requires forgiveness, compassion, and action."" Her relationship with food, particularly chocolate chip cookies, is exemplary of this ongoing process. Noticing that her behavior was driven by sugar cravings (""If there's a parking spot directly in front of my favorite cookie shop, I'll go get one,"" ""I'll drive around the block, maybe when I come back there'll be a spot by the shop."") Chopra knew she had face and address her emotional relationship with food. 

""My relationship with food is complex,"" as she describes it. Memories of her grandma making cakes and cookies come alive again every time she bites into a chocolate chip cookie. We all know that connection is nourishing; it becomes a shadow of itself, however, when we try to recreate those feelings with bandaid placeholders. Now Chopra's realigned focus has informed her intent: She will still enjoy a cookie but (mostly) only if what she really wants is a cookie. ""We don't need to be perfect all the time,"" Chopra says. ""Ultimately, it's all about joy.""



Moreover, it's important to note that living with intent doesn't necessarily equal grand accomplishments. There are ordinary people doing extraordinary things every day, Eckhart Tolle reminds us. The frequency holders, as he calls them, create love, joy, and peace every day when most of the world doesn't even know about them. Yes, soccer moms, he's talking about and to you. And Bernstein emphasizes that, ""We all have opportunities to be a household saint in our own lives.""

It's in her role as a mother that Chopra seems to blossom most. Unlike her celebrity father and preeminent grandfather, Chopra chooses to share her gifts on a smaller, more family-focused scale. ""We all have different journeys,"" she says, ""and that's okay."" How are you #LivingwithIntent?

Kennedy. Over half a century later, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra has chosen to quote the great American composer, a little over a week after the tragic death of Freddie Gray on April 19.

The BSO invoked Bernstein on its Facebook page, part of a statement announcing the orchestra's plans to play a free concert outside the Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall in Baltimore at noon on Wednesday. The hall is located two and half miles from Mondawmin Mall, one of the various locations gripped by looting and violence earlier this week.

&MA: I am heartbroken for our dear city. With so much need alongside so much possibility, I hope we can use any...Posted by Marin Alsop on Tuesday, April 28, 2015


While the Baltimore Orioles gear up to play for an empty stadium -- the first closed-door game in MLB history -- the players of the BSO will step outside to perform. ""An orchestra official said that a number of ensemble’s musicians had decided to donate their time to play music outside their hall, feeling the need to respond to the crisis in their hometown,"" The New York Times' Michael Cooper reported. ""The orchestra is considering other ways in which it can respond in the near future.""

Earlier on Tuesday, BSO music director Marin Alsop commented on the unrest in his city. ""I am heartbroken for our dear city,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""With so much need alongside so much possibility, I hope we can use any opportunities we get to set an example and inspire others to join us in trying to change the world.""

The weekend celebrates Easter and Passover. Good moods have a way of swirling like cartoon steam from a bake shop. It flies out, sweet and deep-breath-inducing, rolling in the air, encircling someone and then carrying on with the breeze. 

Ripple: a small wave or series of waves on the surface of water, especially as caused by an object dropping into it or a slight breeze.

I picture it as an expansive, momentum shift. Each of us vibrating a good mood energetically left in the air to be experienced or transformed by the next person. I honestly believe that's why moods can be ""Contagious!"" 



We are all connected, if by nothing other than the energy we send off with a smile or helping hand. Just like a negative and hateful person can dampen a day or party, the opposite is possible, but I think positivity is far more profound. Singing with a stranger, laughing till it hurts, spreading love through small joyous moments shared. The pheromones and endorphins, and all the good stuff, churn and burn to boost us along our days. 

I'm not saying it's easy. Trust me. Just trying to write these five paragraphs, I've had to break up a fight, get up three times to deal with a screaming toddler, have been interrupted by a dog needing to go out, a phone call, and a scream for help only to find out that my 6-year-old merely couldn't find her spring sweater. Still, I am committed to being positive and sending you happy vibes! 

Let's try it. I'll start with absolute and full intention to brighten your day.
I choose to dodge the dreary, to be nimble around negative thoughts and people, and you will receive my vibrating, palpable zaps of harmonious happy light and love! 

I'm not asking you to pass this post on, or somehow advertise me. I'm nobody...This is not about me. It's about the collective choice we have to positively affect each other every day. So in your own way, inspire a smile, warm a muted heart, give a hand, help hope float, offer positivity and maybe my little ripple will spread to your life. 

Then you drop some joy into the sea of happy, and if all goes well, we can build an under-current, a resiliently bright riptide! 

For you, for me, for all those we will effect today, why not try to create a Harmonious Happy Human Ripple!

Go out into the great open spaces and beam some joy into the ether! DO IT! Feel the beauty in not wanting reciprocation, but simply the grace of sending love because love is free and you want Nothing in return! 

#H3Ripple ideas: 

•	Smile and wish someone a good day! 
•	Hug hard and long with intention to heal the unseen broken bits, silently.
•	Give a friend/family member/foe a compliment from your heart!
•	Open every door for everyone you see out there today!
•	Meditate pure joy into the universe today. (I do everyday.) 
•	Help a stranger purely because it could be you! (Someone struggling with a stroller, about to drop an armful of groceries, needing a dollar to buy a bottled water.)
•	Blow kisses and give BIG LOVE!

HARMONIOUS HAPPY HUMANS!

I'm was standing in his living room. I'm was wearing a long-sleeved, tangerine-colored button up shirt and nothing else. We were talking. I was standing there. I was exposed. That area between the last button and the bottom of my shirt was split open and my penis was exposed. The shirt did feel somewhat like a security blanket, but I was standing in his living room, having a conversation about the ups and downs of life and my mind kept reminding me that my penis was exposed. It was like an out of body experience (I'm imagining) where I was standing beside myself whispering in my own ear, He can see your penis. Let me tell you how I got there.

For years I've been wanting a drawing of a male nude. Anytime I find myself in an art gallery or antique shop that might cater to that style of art I look for something that might pique my interest. One random day my Facebook news feed exposed me to the drawings of an artist friend of mine. I knew that he was an artist, but I just took it for granted and never really thought about it. Drawing is something he does, like writing is something I do. But on this particular day the lightbulb lit up above my head (a Eureka! moment) and I thought to myself, I'll ask Sean Baumgardner if he'll draw a male nude for me. I sent him a Facebook message and much to my delight he responded, ""I've been making male nudes since I hit puberty. Yes."" Then he posed the question, ""What type of man would you like shaped on paper?"" I didn't know. I'd always assumed that I would see a finished piece of art in some gallery and know that I couldn't live without it and that would be that. This was a commission. Should I Google hot nude men? My favorite porn stars? I had no idea. It was during a discussion about this predicament that a friend suggested I be the subject of the male nude. ""If you're commissioning an artist to draw a male nude, why not let the male be you?"" That thought had never entered my mind. And it certainly threw me for a loop. Would it be narcissistic to hang a nude of myself in my apartment? Did I really want a nude of myself?

Then I heard Sex and the City's own Samantha Jones in my head. In season 4, episode 2, Samantha decided to pose nude for a photo shoot so that she could look back one day and say, ""Damn, I was hot."" I laughed to myself. That was the moment I genuinely began to entertain the idea of being the subject of the drawing. Sean is in California. I'm in NYC. The opportunity to sit for him was not an option, and I needed something better than a nude selfie from my iPhone. I asked a friend I trust if he would take photos of me. He said he would but suggested that I have a photographer take professional photos of me in a studio with lighting that neither he nor a selfie could reproduce. 

Is this getting out of hand? First I wanted a drawing. Then the drawing is going to be of me. Now I'm thinking I'll book an actual nude photo shoot so that I have a photo from which the artist can draw me. Who am I? What is going on? Immediately I questioned the expense of the photo shoot. Then the notion of me actually being comfortable as the subject of a nude photo shoot crept into my psyche. I don't often find myself naked in front of someone who isn't also naked in front of me. Usually there's kissing, touching, erections, etc. I didn't know if I could be that vulnerable. And I was damn curious if I might be embarrassed by my assets or by one particular asset's reaction. A penis can be a delicate and sensitive member. When exposed it can shrivel up like it's been in the pool or it can stand at attention at the mere thought of being seen. 

I needed to be courageous. I needed to access my long laid dormant vulnerability. This could be fun, I thought to myself, if you'll let it be. I reached out to the gorgeous and generously kind Seth Fornea on Twitter, explaining the situation and asking for recommendations. He responded quickly with the name Kevin Hoover. I was familiar with Kevin Hoover's work as I follow him on Twitter. He takes beautiful male nude photographs. I was immediately apprehensive as I looked again at the hard, masculine, statuesque bodies in the images on his Twitter page. I gave my own body a disparaging glance in the mirror and thought I didn't measure up. Then I thought, Fuck it! I emailed him and told him I was interested in a nude photo shoot. Pressing send on that email was the first step in what turned out to be a fantastic experience.

I had a mere 27 days to mentally and physically prepare. I had been working out for years, but time and age and laziness had allowed me to get softer than I wanted to be. I began to train very hard with my personal trainer and completely changed my eating habits. My body became leaner, my muscles more defined. The changes were visible within a week. While initially difficult, the process proved to be a challenge worth taking. 

The day finally arrived. I was nervous -- justifiably so. I was also excited. I had a somewhat distracted workout prior to heading to Brooklyn for my 2 p.m. appointment. When I arrived at Kevin's apartment, which comfortably transformed into his studio, I reached out to shake his hand. He gave me a big, good-natured smile and said, ""We do hugs here."" I was immediately at ease. Kevin and I talked and laughed for two hours before we even started. I felt like I'd known him for years. He was so gracious that when I finally found myself standing there with my penis exposed in the split at the bottom of my shirt it didn't really matter. I was aware, but it wasn't awkward. I didn't feel ashamed or the need for concealment. I wasn't shrinking from fear or getting erect from exposure. I was just there...vulnerable, seen. As the camera began to click, the posing became more fun, less tense, and the nudity became an afterthought; a state of being that was playful, celebratory, freeing.

Kevin was extremely generous with me. I was his willing victim and he the artist who listened to the ideas of the strongly opinionated man standing naked in front of him. Not every photo can be fabulous, but that's to be expected. One never knows how many shots are taken to find the one that captures the essence of its subject. Through relaxing conversation and the courage of vulnerability, we created images that turned out to be beautiful, provocative, and fully exposed, while I met a fantastic man for whose camera I'd comfortably get naked again.

The 4 Times coffee table, a pie-chart style contraption, brilliantly hides your trinkets, trash and clutter from whomever might come over for an unexpected visit. Keep a prim vase of flowers on top, and let the four secret pockets underneath store your ripped-up mail, random magazines and the remote control that still lacks working batteries. 

Consider this the mullet of coffee tables: business up top, PARTY underneath.





The 4 Times coffee table retails for about $1,611 from French design house Polit. 

If you'd rather organize the old-fashioned way, these coffee table decor ideas are far more affordable.

e6a033a48cfe1f3f926dece9517ebfb6,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/29/supreme-court-campaign-finance_n_7171270.html,Supreme Court Actually Upholds Campaign Finance Restrictions On Judicial Fundraising,"WASHINGTON -- In a 5-4 decision on Wednesday, the Supreme Court upheld the right of states to ban elected judges from soliciting campaign contributions for their own campaigns. The majority decision was penned by Chief Justice John Roberts and joined by the court’s four liberal justices.

The decision comes after a long string of court rulings that overturned campaign finance regulations, among them the well-known 2010 Citizens United and the 2014 McCutcheon cases. Wednesday's ruling, by contrast, upholds a campaign finance regulation, and does so by making a strong distinction between the role of the judiciary and the role of elected legislative and executive officials.

Explaining this distinction, Roberts, writing for the majority, said: “A State’s interest in preserving public confidence in the integrity of its judiciary extends beyond its interest in preventing the appearance of corruption in legislative and executive elections. As we explained in [Republican Party of Minnesota v. White], States may regulate judicial elections differently than they regulate political elections, because the role of judges differs from the role of politicians.”

In the case before the court, Florida judicial candidate Lanell Williams-Yulee had signed her name to a fundraising solicitation letter while running for office in 2009. She did so despite Florida’s ban on fundraising solicitation by judicial candidates. Candidates like Williams-Yulee are allowed to raise money through campaign committees, but they may not solicit the funds themselves. Williams-Yulee challenged the law as a restriction of her First Amendment right to free speech.

The court, however, did not agree. Instead, it upheld the Florida ban on direct judicial candidate solicitation because of what Roberts described as the unique way the judiciary maintains its authority. While politicians are expected to balance a variety of interests and receive support from various quarters, judges must be seen by the public as being fair and above influence.

“In deciding cases, a judge is not to follow the preferences of his supporters, or provide any special consideration to his campaign donors,” Roberts wrote.

He concluded, “This is therefore one of the rare cases in which a speech restriction withstands strict scrutiny.” -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

And I've been thinking about it ever since.  I've been thinking about it so much that I had to find it again to see if it really is as emblematic of the unfortunate dynamics between teachers and students as I remembered. 

It is.

Not that the advice isn't potentially useful.  My criticism is not with the essay or author or necessarily with the advice, but with the context that requires this advice, a context in which young people have to be manipulated into engaging with us and our content, because if they had the choice, many would choose something else.  

So I've written my own version.  My suggestions are most easily applied in settings where both teachers and students have considerable autonomy, but I hope these ideas may be useful to teachers even in traditional settings.

See what you think:


Working with teenagers can be a joy.  Follow these five easy steps.

1. Say something that feels relevant to your students.

If you work in a typical school, as the vast number of teachers do, you most likely have to spend some time, or perhaps a lot of time, trying to teach things that do not feel relevant to your students.  Unfortunately that may be your job and your mandate.  That's a tough situation.  

Hopefully at least some of the time you get to talk about things that do feel relevant to your students, in which case you know what I mean.  That's when the engagement happens, and that's when we all learn.

2. Become a listener yourself. Offer dialogue, not just assignments or lectures.

This, I believe, is an option in any setting.  Relationships are a two way street.  Listeners beget listeners.  Hopefully you get to have some autonomy on how you run your class and hopefully you have time to build relationships through listening.  

3. Collaborate rather than dictate. 

This builds from listening.  A shared vision is fun, while an assigned, irrelevant project is unpleasant.  Many teachers are masterful in their ability to make the standard curriculum feel collaborative, and I salute you.  I know that is a mountain of work, and that it's effective.  Someday I hope we all have the freedom and support to make space for collaboration.

4. Acknowledge that not everyone cares about what you have to say at any given moment. Respect their right to not listen. 

This can be a really hard one in a setting where students have to care, or pretend to care, or face failure and ruin.  This is too bad, of course.  Having better things to think about is a sign of independence, critical thinking, and creativity.  Those are great skills and qualities.  It's more than unfortunate that students are shamed and punished for refusing to pretend to care when they don't.

Some teachers are able to make space for that choice in a way that is respectful and collaborative.  I love those teachers, and so do their students.

5. Non compulsion. Fill the room with people who choose to be there.

A luxury item, I know, at least in most schools.  For any ballet class or piano lesson or sports practice, people who do not want to be there are encouraged to do something else, because they are unteachable.  No one wants to work with someone who doesn't want to be there, and someone who doesn't want to be there doesn't want to be worked with. 

In everything that is voluntary, this is obvious.  But school is not voluntary, or doesn't feel voluntary to most people, at least, and so we insist on inflicting information on people who don't want to be there, at least some of the time.  Not only is it ineffective in terms of learning, it's actually detrimental. 

When I insist that you swallow what I'm feeding you, right now, on my terms and on my timeline, not only are you extremely unlikely to learn whatever I'm trying to teach, you are likely to ""learn"" that your thoughts, opinions, and autonomy are wrong and don't matter.  You learn that your job is to submit.  

Whatever information we're trying to share can always be learned later.  But learning that your autonomy and opinions don't matter is very hard to unlearn.

No one goes into teaching to teach submission, of course.  Yet we teachers sometimes find ourselves forced to inflict this lesson, ""for their own good.,"" and because it's our job, and because we were good students and learned submission, too.

The five steps that Edutopia offered are probably more helpful in getting through your regular teaching day than anything I have to say.  But I wish you could all have teaching days that were about curiosity, and engagement, and collaboration, and choice, where my suggestions could be more useful.  I believe that our students wish that, too.

Even in an era full of warnings that humans are negatively impacting the planet, governments, individuals, and the private sector have made real progress toward being better stewards of the planet. And much of that progress has come in the world of energy, where scientific and technological advances are improving how we use energy, where we get it from, and how it impacts our surroundings.Those advances could go a long way toward solving climate change, but there’s a lot of work left to be done. If humans continue using fossil fuels at current rates, scientists say that the world will relatively quickly burn through its “carbon budget” – the amount of carbon humans can put into the atmosphere without raising temperatures to dangerous levels.“We may have just about 30 years left until the world’s carbon budget is spent if we want a likely chance of limiting warming to 2 degrees C,” Kelly Levin, a senior associate at the World Resources Institute, a global think tank, wrote last year in a blog post. “Breaching this limit would put the world at increased risk of forest fires, coral bleaching, higher sea level rise, and other dangerous impacts.”But given advances in renewable energy, battery storage, government regulations, and more, there’s plenty of reasons to be optimistic that the world is making progress toward a cleaner energy future.Here are some reasons to be hopeful:",http://rss.csmonitor.com/feeds/environment,,2015-04-29 08:53:59.241000,1,"Protecting the Environment, "

Whew. The wait is finally over. Thank goodness. Now, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers get to stress out for the next three or four years to see what really comes of the first pick of the NFL draft — quarterback Jameis Winston of Florida State.

The Bucs put an end to months of speculation by selecting the talented-but-troubled signal caller, who won the Heisman Trophy in 2013.

Winston was not present in Chicago, choosing to watch the draft at home in Alabama.

(Oh, and Commissioner Roger Goodell got booed again when he came out to announce the pick.)

Winston apparently did enough to convince the owners of the first pick that he's worth the risk.

He's the first QB to be selected first since Andrew Luck in 2012. Winston is also the first player from Florida State, which produces gobs of NFL talent, to be picked first in the draft.

Tennessee is on the clock.

Some news in the lead-up to the NFL draft, which starts in about a half-hour:

—The league denies a request from LSU offensive lineman La'el Collins to pull his name out of the draft and be placed in the supplemental draft later this year. Police want to talk to Collins, a projected first-round pick, about the slaying of his ex-girlfriend. He is not considered a suspect.

—The Titans, who hold the second pick, will entertain offers for that pick but those offers probably won't be coming from the Chargers. A report out of San Diego says quarterback Philip Rivers, in search of a contract extension, has been told he won't be traded.

—The Randy Gregory watch is on. The Nebraska pass rusher's stock has taken a hit since news hit that he tested positive for marijuana at the NFL scouting combine. Gregory was thought to be a top-10 pick, though some reports today speculate he has fallen completely off several teams' draft boards.

Are these clues? Or is he just trying to drive all those 12th men crazy?

Seahawks coach Pete Carroll is trying to generate some buzz over Seattle's draft, even though the Seahawks don't (currently) have a pick until the end of the second round - a selection that won't be made until tomorrow night.

Carroll is tweeting out #SeahawksDraftClues that, so far, involve a few skits from comedian Dave Chappelle's old — and very funny — TV show.

The draft starts in about an hour. The Auditorium Building at Roosevelt University in Chicago is starting to fill up.

Let's boil it down to the basics: A group of executives at 32 multimillion-dollar companies are about to spend several of those millions, and risk their company's future, on a 21-year-old college kid.

Welcome to the NFL draft.

Character issues are always on the front burner this time of year — and that's never more true than tonight, where NFL executives will take all their data and make life-changing decisions about a number of players who are flawed in different ways that have nothing to do with throwing, running or catching.

Scott Minto, director of the San Diego State Sports Business MBA program, says no amount of vetting, psychological profiling and background checking can ensure a team of making the right pick.

""You see these players who have transgressions in their past and how do you decide if this player's going to be a good employee or not?"" Minto asks. ""It's a lot of money to invest into someone who's 22 or 23 years old.""

1:05 p.m. (2:05 p.m. EDT)

Well, it's not exactly March Madness. Then again, it wouldn't be a true sporting event if you didn't have a chance to win something based on the outcome, right?

As part of its never-ending and generally successful quest to make every date on its calendar an Event, the NFL has created a contest challenging fans to predict the top 32 picks in this year's draft. Winner gets an all-expense-paid trip to the season-opening game, Steelers at Patriots, on September 10th.

Much like the gazillions of bracket-filling contests that make the NCAA Tournament what it is, this contest offers chances to form leagues with your buddies, play against strangers and, of course, compete for the grand prize valued at around $4,800. This way, your future and your happiness as an NFL fan can hinge on every pick during tonight's four-hour extravaganza, not simply the one your favorite team makes.

Need help? Vegas is here for ya. The over-under on Alabama receiver Amari Cooper's draft position has been set at 4 1/2, per the Bovada website. Bovada has also set 1 1/2 as the over-under for number of running backs — an increasingly unpopular position in NFL-land — to be selected in the first round.

___

11:50 a.m. (12:50 p.m. EDT)

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are on the clock. The Tennessee Titans are under the microscope.

With the hours ticking down until the start of the NFL draft in Chicago, the Bucs will surprise everyone if they don't use the top pick to take Jameis Winston, the troubled, talented quarterback out of Florida State. That surprise will turn to shock if they pass on both Winston and this year's other top quarterback, Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Mariota of Oregon.

What the Titans will do is less certain. The smart money says they'll take Mariota (or Winston if Tampa Bay unexpectedly passes), but Tennessee likes its current QB, Zach Mettenberger, and if the price is right, the Titans could trade that pick away.

Those potentially in the market for the Heisman winner: San Diego, which can't get an extension done with Philip Rivers; Philadelphia, whose coach, Chip Kelly, worked with Mariota at Oregon; and, yes, the Cleveland Browns, who have two first-round picks and aren't quite sure what they've got with last year's glamour pick, quarterback Johnny Manziel.

Only a little more than seven hours to go.

And, by the way, neither Winston nor Mariota will be on hand to shake Commissioner Roger Goodell's hand after they're selected. Winston will be watching from Alabama and Mariota is in Hawaii.

95c49fdea7242134e33f4dd7d4712573,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/30/freddie-gray-death-questions_n_7182428.html,Someone Isn't Telling The Truth About Freddie Gray's Death,"By now, everybody knows the injuries that contributed to Freddie Gray's death. Baltimore authorities and representatives for Gray’s family agree that the 25-year-old sustained fatal trauma to his neck and spine at some point while in police custody following his arrest on April 12. Although a full autopsy hasn't yet been released, the family has said that Gray’s spine was nearly severed, and that his doctors had attempted to repair three fractured neck vertebrae and a crushed voice box. Last week, The Baltimore Sun spoke to medical experts who said that Gray's injuries were, in the paper's words, comparable to those seen in “victims of high-speed crashes.”

On Thursday, unnamed law enforcement sources told WJLA that according to a police report shared with prosecutors earlier that day, an investigation into Gray's death suggested the fatal injuries occurred when Gray slammed into the back of the police transport van. The officer driving the van has not yet given a statement.

While this may end up being a significant detail of the investigation, much is still unclear about the circumstances of Gray's death, including how Gray's head might have hit the wall of the van hard enough to kill him. Over the past few weeks, Baltimore police have provided few answers about how Gray went from seemingly healthy enough to flee police on the morning of April 12 to dead on April 19 after a week in a coma. On Wednesday, April 29, hours after stating that they would not give the public their forthcoming internal report on Gray's death, police leaked a different document to The Washington Post. It was the first new piece of information from police in nearly a week. But instead of clarity, it offered more confusion. 

The Post reported that a prisoner who was in the van with Gray allegedly told investigators he could hear Gray ""banging against the walls"" of the police vehicle, and said he believed Gray was ""intentionally trying to injure himself,"" according to a document written by a Baltimore police investigator. However, in a subsequent interview with WBAL, the man, identified as Donte Allen, seemed to walk back his claims.

Allen's remarks are just the latest entry in a series of questions and inconsistencies that have left the public wondering what really happened to Freddie Gray. None of this necessarily means that someone is lying about it, but clearly someone, intentionally or otherwise, is not telling the truth.

Did police have probable cause to arrest Gray?



Gray is seen in an undated family photo.


Court documents filed by Baltimore police Officer Garrett Miller claim that Gray caught the attention of the police because he ran. Deputy Commissioner Kevin Davis told reporters that three officers chased Gray -- one on foot and two on bikes. “It’s a foot chase,” he said, “and it’s a long one.” When asked last week for an explanation for Gray’s arrest, Baltimore police Commissioner Anthony Batts said that “just running -- there is no law against running.”

A witness told the Sun that Gray may have run because he had previously been beaten by one of the officers.

Whatever the reason, court papers show that the only charge police intended to file against Gray was for possession of a switchblade knife, which they say was clipped to the inside of his front pants pocket.

Was force used during Freddie Gray’s arrest?


In its account of Gray’s arrest, the Baltimore Police Department has maintained that he was picked up “without force or incident.” The court documents filed by Miller say that Gray was nabbed by police because he “fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence.” After police found the knife, he was arrested.

In its reporting of the incident, The Baltimore Sun found witnesses who refuted Miller's account to the court. In an April 25 article, Sun reporter Kevin Rector wrote: “Kevin Moore, a 28-year-old friend of Gray's from Gilmor Homes, said he rushed outside when he heard Gray was being arrested and saw him ‘screaming for his life’ with his face planted on the ground. One officer had his knee on Gray's neck, Moore said, and another was bending his legs backward. ‘They had him folded up like he was a crab or a piece of origami,’ Moore said. ‘He was all bent up.’"" Other alleged eyewitnesses claimed to have seen officers beating Gray with their batons. 

At one point during the arrest, according to the police commissioner, an officer pulled out a stun gun. Moore claimed to have seen this as well. According to the Sun, police investigators failed to obtain footage from a convenience store surveillance camera that may have captured the incident more clearly. Instead, the officers found that the moment in question had been taped over by the time they got there. This was a common theme throughout the investigation, as officers reportedly failed to obtain footage from other cameras that may have recorded key moments in Gray's subsequent ride to the police station.

A third perspective on Gray's arrest was added to the mix on Wednesday, when CNN interviewed an anonymous relative of one of the arresting officers. The woman said the officer believes Gray ""was injured outside the paddy wagon,"" though she expressed personal concern that ""six officers are going to be punished behind something that maybe one or two or even three officers may have done to Freddie Gray.""

 Was Gray injured before he was loaded into the van? 



A family photo shows Gray in the hospital after his arrest.


While police insist they didn't use force on Gray during the arrest, Davis appeared to suggest last week that Gray was injured before he was put in the van, and that officers failed to offer medical assistance despite requests from Gray.

""Quite frankly, that's exactly where Freddie Gray should have received medical attention,"" said Davis, referring to the scene of the arrest. ""He did not.""

According to witnesses, Gray's legs looked like they had been damaged during the arrest. He was also having trouble breathing, and police say he asked for an inhaler and other assistance but was denied.

Police have also claimed that a preliminary autopsy report showed that Gray's only injury was the one to his spinal cord. The full results of that examination are still forthcoming.

Batts said last week that officers didn't exercise proper protocol following whatever injuries Gray supposedly sustained while in the van. “No excuses for me. Period,” Batts said. “We know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times.”

But according to the charging documents filed in court, police claimed to have attended to Gray with proper urgency. Miller described the arrest as by-the-book: ""During transport to Western District via wagon transport the defendant suffered a medical emergency and was immediately transported to Shock Trauma via medic."" 

What happened during Gray's van ride?


This is the critical question, and there is still no clear answer. Witness video shows Gray screaming at the time he was loaded into the vehicle. According to the official police timeline, the van made its first stop four minutes later so that officers could shackle an ""irate"" Gray. He was removed from the van and was placed in leg irons.

At this point, witnesses report seeing a ""commotion"" in which they say police hit Gray with batons. Again, police have maintained that a preliminary autopsy report indicates Gray didn't suffer any injuries other than the one to his spinal cord.

Police and witnesses then agree that Gray was returned to the van in both hand and leg restraints. Officers have admitted they didn't buckle Gray's seat belt, a violation of police department policy that has led to suggestions that Gray may have been the victim of a ""rough ride"" -- an illegal but not uncommon technique in which officers drive vans in such a way as to cause injury to detained passengers.

A few minutes later, a second stop was reportedly made. The fact of this stop was not reported until Thursday, April 30, 18 days after Gray's arrest. Police said they learned about the second stop while canvassing local businesses in search of surveillance footage of the van. It's unclear what happened during this episode.

At 8:59 a.m., about 15 minutes after Gray was first put in the van, the vehicle stopped for a third time after the driver asked an officer to perform a check on Gray. This had previously been explained as the second stop, and exactly what happened there was reportedly a key part of the investigation. Batts has said that responding officers had to ""pick [Gray] up off the floor and place him on the seat,"" and that Gray requested a medic at this time. He was ignored again.

The fourth and final stop was made minutes later to pick up another prisoner. At this point, it's unclear what state Gray was in. Davis has suggested that Gray was again found on the floor, but responsive enough to make another request for a medic. If this request was indeed made, it was evidently denied. Other reports suggest that Gray may have already lost consciousness when this second person was picked up.

Whatever the case, the account of the second prisoner, Donte Allen, was leaked to The Washington Post on Wednesday. It has led to questions about what happened during the minutes-long, six-block ride to Baltimore's Western District station, where police say Gray was removed from the van unconscious and unable to breathe.

How was Gray acting in the police van?


Details of Allen's account conflict with earlier reports on Gray's time in the van, including reports from police officials themselves. According to the Post, Allen told investigators that Gray was “banging against the walls” and ""intentionally trying to injure himself.” But Allen later told WBAL: ""When I got in the van, I didn't hear nothing. It was a smooth ride. We went straight to the police station. All I heard was a little banging for about four seconds. I just heard little banging, just little banging.""

WBAL investigative reporter Jayne Miller had told MSNBC on Wednesday that her own reporting suggested Gray was in no state to behave in the manner described in the Post report.

“According to our sources, by the time that prisoner is loaded into that van, Freddie Gray was unresponsive,” Miller said. “Secondly, we have reported [there] is no evidence, medical evidence, that Freddie Gray suffered any injury that indicates that he injured himself.”

Medical professionals have also said the catastrophic nature of Gray's trauma suggests it was not self-inflicted.

Thursday's developments about the nature of Gray's injury don't necessarily change any of Miller's reporting. If the only factor in his death was in fact the spinal damage he reportedly suffered while in the back of the police van, the circumstances of that incident remain unclear.

In fact, only one thing has become clear since Freddie Gray's death: The police aren't telling the whole story. And what they have chosen to disclose has in most cases left us with further questions, not concrete answers. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

4effa8fca36085a9a39779077677b25e,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/30/freddie-gray_n_7186002.html,Police Van Carrying Freddie Gray Made Previously Undisclosed Second Stop,"BALTIMORE (AP) -- The refusal of authorities to provide more than a few sketchy details about the Freddie Gray investigation may be legally appropriate, but many people in Baltimore were finding it hard to be patient Thursday when police revealed nothing about the internal investigation they turned over to the state's attorney's office.

Nearly two weeks after Gray's death, the public still doesn't know much more than it did on Day One. The central question - what caused his fatal spinal cord injury - remains a mystery.

""The transparency is just not there,"" the Rev. Cortly ""C.D."" Witherspoon said after Police Commissioner Anthony Batts refused to answer any questions Thursday.

Batts said his department's report was delivered a day ahead of time to State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby, and that from now on, any questions should go to her.

Mosby also declined to talk, issuing a statement Thursday asking ""for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system.""

With rumors flying about how Gray's spine was ""80 percent severed,"" as his family's lawyer Billy Murphy put it, police did release a new piece of information Thursday, but it served mostly to raise more questions about how truthful the six suspended officers have been with investigators.

Deputy Commissioner Kevin Davis said investigators discovered a security camera recording showing that the police van carrying Gray had made a previously undisclosed, second stop, after the 25-year-old black man was put in leg irons and before the van driver made a third stop and called for help to check on his condition. The van then made a fourth stop, to pick up another passenger, before Gray arrived at the police station with the fatal spinal-cord injury that left him unresponsive.

The Associated Press talked later Thursday with grocery store owner Jung Hyun Hwang, who said officers came in last week to make a copy. Speaking in Korean, he said the only other copy had been stolen, along with his video equipment, when looters destroyed his store Monday night. He told the AP that he didn't see what the recording showed.

Police had said Gray was obviously injured and asking for medical help when he was hoisted into the van on April 12, and unresponsive on arrival at the station. He died in a hospital after a week in a coma.

Then, last week, Batts said the additional passenger who was picked up along the way had told investigators the driver did not speed, make sudden stops or ""drive erratically"" during the trip, and that Gray was ""was still moving around, that he was kicking and making noises"" up until the van arrived at the police station.

Baltimore police have been less forthcoming than police in Ferguson, Missouri, after white officer Darren Wilson fatally shot a black man, 18-year-old, Michael Brown, last year in an incident officially deemed self-defense. For example, Baltimore police haven't publicly revealed the suspended officers' races or disciplinary histories.

Beyond the slim chronology, authorities have refused to discuss evidence, such as the details of his handling to statements from any of the six suspended officers. Their names are known only because the AP and other news organizations filed public records requests for the documents police filed seeking to have Gray charged with carrying a switchblade.

""I understand there are questions people want to have answered, but unfortunately, we can't release any more about it,"" Capt. J. Eric Kowalczyk said.

The forensic pathologists who studied Gray's body for clues also aren't making official statements.

Bruce Goldfarb, a spokesman for the Maryland State Medical Examiner's Office, told the AP Thursday that the office has completed Gray's autopsy, but the forensic investigation is still in process and no conclusions have been sent to police or prosecutors. When the report is complete, Goldfarb said, a copy will be sent to the Baltimore State's Attorney's Office.

""The autopsy has been done, it only takes about two and a half hours,"" Goldfarb said. ""The autopsy is only one part of the forensic investigation. The whole point is to determine cause and manner of death, and there are lab tests and lots of other things that have to be done.""

Legal experts and the Gray family lawyers say secrecy is appropriate at this point in the probe, when it's still possible that some witnesses haven't been questioned, or even found.

""By releasing too many details, you run the risk that witnesses' testimony will change to mirror the details you have released,"" said David S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice in Miami. He said investigators must verify or corroborate much of the information they receive, and meanwhile the public could be misled that the probe is leading to a particular outcome.

Investigators also face challenges with police that are different from killings by civilians. There's the question of whether an officer acted ""reasonably"" considering the circumstances - a common defense in use-of-force cases. And investigators can't simply force officers to give statements or lose their jobs, because that would mean their testimony is coerced, and therefore wouldn't hold up in court, Weinstein said.

""If they are compelled to give a statement as a condition of their employment, you cannot then use those statements against them in a criminal proceeding,"" he said. ""This is where the decision to grant immunity comes into play.""

The Gray family's lawyers sought to dispel the idea that the police report would be made public at this point.

""This family wants justice, and they want justice that comes at the right time and not too soon,"" attorney Hassan Murphy said Wednesday.

People are right to demand transparency, but the appropriate time for disclosure is either during a trial, if charges are filed, or when prosecutors announce no indictments, said Steve Levin, a former federal prosecutor in Baltimore who now works as a defense attorney.

The voracious 24-hour news cycle is another factor, especially so when civil unrest and violence are involved. Saturating the public with information prior to filing criminal charges also can make it extremely difficult to seat an impartial jury later, said Robert Jarvis, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University.

""It makes it appear that they are not doing anything, which leads to unfounded criticism and can rush law enforcement into ill-considered action,"" Jarvis said.

Meanwhile, protests over Gray's death are spreading and continuing. Crowds gathered Thursday in Philadelphia and Baltimore. Other protests led to arrests in New York and elsewhere. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

Why do babies cry? Why do toddlers suddenly go limp and throw themselves onto the shiny white floor of the soap aisle in Target? Why do drunk men fight at bars?

Why do oppressed young men riot? 

The inability to communicate breeds frustration and anger. I know this firsthand as I watched my mountain of an ex-cop grandfather struggle for years after suffering a stroke a couple of years after retiring from the force. His ability to speak had deteriorated to such a point that he would routinely throw a fit in frustration over family members not understanding what he was saying. It was hard to see, but we understood his anger. 

This is why the baby cries. This is why the four-year-old screams for seemingly no real or valid reason. This is why young men -- white, black, or brown -- riot. Because for whatever reason, their ability to verbalize is clouded behind the thick walls of failed government and social policies. 

It is why calling them ""thugs,"" as CNN's Erin Burnett wanted to do, is inaccurate. 

What would be accurate is to suggest that the ""thugs"" are those who have been in charge of the city of Baltimore for the past four decades, who by all accounts, haven't done a thing to improve their city since the riots of '68 happened following the death of Martin Luther King Jr. The aftermath of those riots is still seen by the abandoned buildings and burned out businesses that still litter the city. 

Burning cars and looting businesses is just a method built out of convenience. Rioters will use whatever is near for them to use, as was the case in Keene, NH last year when college kids (mainly white suburban kids) used pumpkins and beer cans to hurl at police during the town's Great Pumpkin Festival.  They, too, overturned and set cars on fire. 

Many thought Paul Revere was a thug. Yes, that Paul Revere. The man who warned us that the British were coming was a constant thorn in Britain's side. He was also a rebel and hung out with ""the wrong crowd"" (even by 18th century standards). He was a thief, and by all accounts, yes, a thug. Had the Boston Massacre taken place 200 years later, we'd have seen cars burned, a CVS looted, and a motorcycle gang popping wheelies in and out of a euphoric group of protesters. Among the canisters of tear gas and burning gasoline, we'd probably see Paul Revere. 

Let us not focus on how we riot, but why  we riot. 

Why do we riot?

1. why Charlie Hebdo was and is more respectful to Muslims than the idiots who think they are honoring Islam by killing; 

2. that the real provocateurs were not the cartoonists themselves but those who waved the cartoons under the noses of Muslims who otherwise would not have seen them, thereby stirring up demonstrations that served, here, to draw attention from their own infamy; there, to appropriate the mantle of true defender of the prophet; or, on other occasions, to apply pressure in one or another international negotiation (for example, on nuclear power); 

3. that the cover Charlie Hebdo ran after the killing, the cover depicting the prophet with a tear in his eye and the caption ""All is forgiven,"" was the most peaceful, elegant, and conciliatory message conceivable and that those who asserted otherwise were inflammatory cynics; 

4. that those who dared to say that Charlie ""had it coming"" are like the louts who say, after a woman is raped, ""Her skirt was too short"";

5. that the anti-Charlie coalition in France is a motley crew in which one finds the neofascist Le Pen (who detects in the affair the hand of the ""secret services""), the Islamic brother Tariq Ramadan (who declared that Charb and Wolinski were ""cowards""), the former cartoonist Siné (who has never been ""afraid to admit,"" as he did once on the radio, that he is an anti-Semite who wants ""every Jew to live in fear""), the Indivisibles (the supposedly left-wing sect that, after having agreed with Bin Laden's assertion in 2010 that he ""had the right"" to respond to the banning of the burqa in France with decapitations in Pakistan, declared that the problem was not terrorist attacks but the ""climate of Islamophobia"" that inspired them), and the always-present appeasers (who, in this case, are the proponents of a holy alliance of religions);

6. that, in adhering to this position of putative wisdom and forbearance and in solemnly swearing never, ever to criticize thy neighbor's taboo, one must ignore the inconvenient detail that what is taboo for group A is almost always blasphemy for group B, and that sacramentalizing taboos helps propel the merry-go-round of murderous, mimetic violence;

7. that incitement to murder is a felony, whereas laughing at religion, even ridiculing it, is a right;

8. that racism against French citizens of Muslim heritage is criminal, whereas criticism of the Koran, like criticism of Jewish and Christian holy scriptures, is an expression of secularism;

9. that some caricatures stigmatize whereas others, such as those of Charlie Hebdo, emancipate;

10. that there are those who try, through laughter, to strengthen the solidarity of the shaken; others who seek to set one group against another; 

11. that the concept of Islamophobia is an empty one that serves only to disarm the anti-racist vigilance mounted against the anti-Jewish, anti-Christian, anti-atheist, and even anti-Muslim hate preached by some Muslims; 

12. that it is possible, alas, to be both a Muslim and a racist;

13. that minorities are not always right and that when they are wrong -- when the oppressed and excluded themselves become racist -- we must not hesitate to point this out;

14. that many who say ""I don't want to stigmatize the oppressed"" or ""I'm afraid that in passing judgment I will add to their insecurity and unhappiness"" really mean that they do not want to offend the Saudis (proponents of the burqa), irritate the Pakistanis (for whom declaring oneself to be a Catholic, as Asia Bibi did, is a crime punishable by death), or even, while we're on the subject, wound the North Koreans (who would love to see us censor films that make fun of them);

15. that if we follow reasoning like this it will not be long before our civil and criminal codes are cluttered with all the laws of all the world's dictatorships; 

16. that, curiously, the same American television executives who elected not to show the Charlie Hebdo caricatures did not hesitate to show the battered body of the police officer who was protecting Charb: Are they hypocrites? Did they decide, after thinking it over, that it was less costly to offend the grieving family of a defender of democracy than the royal family of Qatar or Kuwait?

17. that, when one takes a good look at the great scenes of jihadism, when one considers that the assassins of Theo Van Gogh and of the attack on the cultural center in Copenhagen grew up in the European cities that are the most open to foreigners, when one realizes that Jihadi John, one of the Islamic State's most virulent decapitators, is a graduate of the University of Westminster, when one thinks of the billionaire Bin Laden or of Omar Saeed Sheikh, the moneyed young man who kidnapped Daniel Pearl, when one remembers, inversely, that it was undocumented, unmoneyed Lassana Bathily who saved six Jews, one of them a baby, at the kosher market in Vincennes, it is no longer possible to decently assert a correlation between terrorism and the ""rifts in our society""; 

18. that poverty is not an excuse;

19. that one falls into jihadism out of ideology or personal proclivity, not out of social desperation. 

Caroline Fourest's Eloge du blasphème is indeed a must-read. Few books are as bracing, stimulating, and immediately useful in the struggles that have been thrust upon us.

While looting indisputably did occur in the unrest that unfolded Monday in Baltimore, users of social media who spread misinformation cause their own special kind of harm. In a situation already fraught with tension and misunderstanding, these images represent a deliberate attempt to promote and isolate perceptions of the community as violent and unrepentantly criminal.

The reality is much more complicated, as groups of Baltimore residents often worked to protect stores from looters or stop the violence, cleaned up after the melee, and some have even turned themselves in to police.

Vice's Motherboard identifies several of the Twitter accounts posting fake photos as having associations with 8chan and GamerGate.

Meanwhile, a number of other Twitter users are attempting to counteract the misinformation with posts calling out the hoax.

As a recent Medium posts notes, a simple reverse image search on Google can help to identify misattributed images that get slipped into the steady stream of Twitter updates that tend to accompany protests. Alternet points out that a similar campaign, with a similar hashtag, was perpetuated in the wake of Superstorm Sandy in 2012.

In a story already going viral, the Mirror reports that traces of cocaine were found on the surface of a toilet cistern just ""yards away"" from the hospital ward where Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, is expected to give birth to the next royal baby any day now.

There are a few reasons you might not want to get excited.

The traces of cocaine were found in a wing of St. Mary’s Hospital where the duchess is not staying -- not on ""Kate Middleton's hospital toilet,"" as the Mirror headline claims. The duchess is in a separate maternity ward.

Reporter Martin Bagot conducted the cocaine test by himself, with an over-the-counter, drug-testing surface wipe. The results haven't been confirmed by a lab, the Mirror reports.

And, perhaps most important of all, traces of cocaine can be found on every public surface you touch.

A 2011 study, conducted in the New Haven, Connecticut, metro area, also used cocaine-detecting surface wipes and found that 35 of 45 public surfaces tested had traces of cocaine. According to the study:

Fuel pump buttons (for credit card authorization) caused 100% positive results. Ten different service stations were tested. Similarly, ATM machines for cash withdrawal resulted in a 100% positive rate. From shopping carts, there were seven out of 10 positives (70%). Academic building entrance doors showed the lowest positive frequency at 30%. Shopping mall entrance/exit doors tested positive in every instance.

In fact, you don't have to search further than your own pocket or purse to find traces of cocaine. A 2009 study found that 90 percent of all U.S. currency has traces of cocaine, according to CNN.

What other harmful substances can be found on our money? CNN reported:

Disease-causing organisms such as staphylococcus aureus and pneumonia-causing bacteria have been detected in paper bills. According to a 2002 study published in the Southern Medical Journal, 94 percent of the tested bills had potentially disease-causing organisms.

Adam Negrusz, an associate professor of forensic sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said he isn't worried about the cleanliness of money in terms of public health.

""I never think about this as a source of danger. We have more things which can be potentially harmful,"" said Negrusz, who was not involved in [the 2009] study.

Tabloids in the United Kingdom have a history of exaggerating the facts or running with news tips without verification. But even the tabloids know the ""Kate Middleton's toilet"" story is ridiculous. In 2011, The Telegraph reported that cocaine could be found on nine out of 10 baby changing stations in public toilets. That could be more worrisome for the royal baby -- if the baby's diapers are ever changed in a public toilet.

Really, Daily Mirror, why not go the whole nine yards? Run headlines like ""WHITE HOUSE INDEED! Cocaine Found Yards Away From Obama's Office"" or ""Cocaine Found Just Inches Away From This Reporter's Nose."" -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

Scott Walker (R) has cast himself as a conservative hardliner on immigration and an uncompromising opponent of what he calls “amnesty.”

But back in 2006, when he was in his fourth year as Milwaukee County executive, not only did Walker support a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, he signed off on a lobbying campaign to push Congress and the White House to support the McCain-Kennedy bill that sought a comprehensive immigration overhaul. 

With the immigration issue set once again to be at the forefront of the Republican presidential race, Walker’s shifting stance on the issue has increasingly become a political albatross for the second-term governor. 

Walker’s previous support for comprehensive immigration reform has already been well documented. Politico reported earlier this year that Walker signed a resolution in 2006 that originally called on Congress to pass the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act, the official name for the McCain-Kennedy bill. (The Walker camp noted that the resolution was subsequently revised in a way that did not specifically call for the bill's passage, though it did continue to advocate for comprehensive reform.)  

But Milwaukee County’s efforts under Walker’s leadership to lobby the federal government to relax the nation’s immigration laws has not previously been publicized.

Disclosure documents obtained by The Huffington Post reveal that in 2006, the Milwaukee County government paid the lobbying firm Waterman & Associates approximately $40,000 to lobby the White House and both branches of Congress in support of the McCain-Kennedy bill.

The bill -- which would have imposed fines, payment of back taxes and probationary status as a prerequisite for undocumented immigrants to earn legal status -- ended up languishing in Congress, and heated debate on the issue continues to this day.

Walker's camp noted that the lobbying effort was specifically directed by the county board chair, not the county executive. But in his official capacity, Walker did approve and sign off on the lobbying initiative. 

Asked to comment on his dramatic change of heart on the issue, Walker spokeswoman AshLee Strong pointed to the Wisconsin governor's opposition to President Barack Obama's series of executive orders in November that barred millions of undocumented immigrants from being deported. 

""Governor Walker has met amazing people from all over the world who immigrated here and contribute greatly to our country,"" Strong said. ""He has clearly and repeatedly stated that President Obama’s unconstitutional executive action and the collateral damage it has had on his fellow governors has made it evident that we need to set priorities, including repealing the executive action.""

Walker’s avowed support for an immigration overhaul goes at least as far back as 2002 -- the first year that he held the Milwaukee County executive position -- when he signed a resolution calling on Congress to permit “comprehensive immigration reform” that would grant “greater opportunity for undocumented working immigrants to obtain legal residency in the United States.” 

Walker’s position appeared not to change for more than 12 years. 

In July 2013, for instance, he was asked during an interview with the Daily Herald Media editorial board of Wisconsin whether he could envision a scenario in which undocumented immigrants would be able to obtain legal status. 

""Sure,"" Walker responded. ""I mean I think it makes sense.""

After securing re-election as governor in November, however, Walker began to change dramatically on the issue. 

In a February interview with ABC News, Walker said he opposed “amnesty” and criticized “plans that have been pushed here in Washington.” 

But the very next month, Walker’s commitment to his newfound opposition to comprehensive immigration reform came into question, when The Wall Street Journal reported that he said at a private dinner in New Hampshire that undocumented immigrants should be allowed to remain in the United States and eventually become citizens. A Walker spokesperson disputed the report. 

Immigration is just one of several major national issues in which Walker has shifted his position in recent years -- a record that exposes him to charges of political expediency similar to those Mitt Romney faced in his two runs for the presidency. 

As the race for the Republican nomination gears up in earnest, the recent revelations of the extent to which Walker previously supported comprehensive immigration reform may prove particularly toxic for the likely Republican candidate, who has risen into the top tier of 2016 contenders. 

While most members of the developing Republican presidential field are firmly opposed to a pathway to citizenship, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) has remained steadfast in backing it.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla), meanwhile, has disavowed his previous support for comprehensive immigration reform, which culminated in his co-sponsorship of a 2013 Senate bill that would have created a pathway to citizenship. 

On the heels of Romney’s poor performance with Hispanic voters in 2012, national Republican strategists have sought to emphasize outreach to this key demographic, which composed about 10 percent of the electorate that year. 

Walker’s approach, however, has been to emphasize his newfound opposition to immigration reform. 

In an interview with Glenn Beck this week, Walker took a giant step further in his approach, by suggesting that reassessing the nation’s current system for legal immigration should be “at the forefront of our discussion.” 

And on illegal immigration, his position could not be more different from when he signed off on Milwaukee County’s pro-immigration reform lobbying effort. 

“No amnesty,” Walker said in an interview with radio host Howie Carr this week. “If you want to be a citizen, that’s a whole different thing. You got to go back to your country of origin and get back in line like anybody else.” -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

The official announcement will reportedly be made during the week of May 11.

According to CBS Chicago, President Barack Obama implied that he would choose the South Side of Chicago during a phone call to Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) last Friday. Also on the call were other state Democratic officials, whom Obama thanked for passing legislation that would allow the library to be built on Chicago park land.

The Sun-Times had also strongly hinted since mid-March that the South Side site was all but a done deal.

A spokesman at the University of Chicago, which has heavily championed a South Side location, could not confirm the news to The Huffington Post.

The university's efforts have been led by Susan Sher, an adviser to the university's president, Robert Zimmer, and a former chief of staff for first lady Michelle Obama. 

The Obamas have deep roots on the South Side: Michelle Obama grew up there, and the president began his political career as a community organizer there before serving as an Illinois state senator representing the area. He also taught at the University of Chicago's law school for 12 years.

The University of Chicago's bid was reportedly chosen over bids from Columbia University in New York (Obama's alma mater), the University of Hawaii and the University of Illinois at Chicago.

The decision on where to build was delayed because the Obama Foundation, which oversees the logistics and fundraising for the library, had reservations about the University of Chicago's bid, which proposed two sites located on park land owned by neither the university nor the city of Chicago. Both sites were controlled by the Chicago Park District, but in March, Emanuel and the Chicago City Council worked out a deal to transfer control of the land to the city.

The Obama Foundation again delayed the decision when Emanuel was facing a runoff challenge in the recent mayoral race -- it did not want the library to factor into the contest. Emanuel has been very active in pushing for a Chicago location. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

Earlier this week, the army said it rescued nearly 300 women and girls from the same forest in the north eastern Borno state as it fights to quash the six-year Islamist insurgency.

""They have been evacuated to a safety zone for further processing,"" Colonel Sani Usman said in a statement without specifying the number of people saved from the group, which seeks to create a caliphate in western Africa.

The group, whose name means ""Western education is sinful"", has snatched at least 2,000 women and girls from their families since the start of 2014, according to Amnesty International.

Many of them have ended up as sex slaves or are used as human shields by the militants.

The uprising poses the greatest security threat to Africa's largest economy and leading oil producer, but it was only the mass kidnapping of more than 200 schoolgirls from a school in Chibok a year ago that focused the world's attention.

In the last two months, the Nigerian army has taken back control of swathes of territory in the remote north with the backing of troops from neighboring Chad, Niger and Cameroon.

Nigerians hope president-elect Muhammadu Buhari, a former army general, will stamp out the rebellion which his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan, struggled to confront.

And his mission was a success. Even a week out, especially as initial questions around national security ease off, Hughes's epic stunt remains a lasting conversation starter on the demand for election reform in America.

From the floors of Congress with Rep. Walter Jones (R-NC) saying, ""Mr. Hughes does have a point"" to Comedy Central's Daily Show segment dubbing him the ""Chitty Chitty Mailman,"" Hughes single-handedly piloted campaign finance reform into the limelight. 

Last Thursday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi announced the ""relaunch"" of a ""Democracy for All"" task force to reduce money in politics. While Rep. Donna Edwards (D-MD) told Bloomberg, ""It doesn't take the landing of a gyrocopter on the Capitol to underscore the frustration that the American people feel about our campaign finance and election system,"" it did seem to have taken a creative and buzz-worthy act of civil disobedience for our legislators to prioritize solutions and for the mainstream media to report it.

Civil disobedience is a key part of our country's history.  The point of civil disobedience is to be bold and disruptive. The point is to break the rules. When Rosa Parks was arrested for sitting in the front of the bus and refusing to move for a white passenger, her guts and defiance helped catapult the Civil Rights Movement into the national spotlight.  Perhaps Hughe's and his flying machine is the modern day equivalent for the movement to get big money out of politics.

Much like the Civil Rights Movement, the movement to end political corruption is about voice, representation, and political equality.  When the Supreme Court ruled in Buckly v. Valeo that money is free speech, they set a new, unprecedented law of the land: whoever has the most money has the loudest voice.  As a result, big money in politics has drowned out the voices of ordinary citizens and it has distorted our representative government, skewing it towards the interests of the wealthy elites who are willing to pay-to-play.   It's a system that Sen. John McCain describes as ""Legalized bribery.""

If we're going to win common sense reforms to get big money out of politics, we need more people like Hughes to tread the avenue of dissent. 

In the past year, members of the activist group 99Rise burst into the Supreme Court on three separate occasions to demand campaign finance reform, which quickly garnered the attention of the media. 

Over 35,000 people have joined the guerrilla campaign StampStampede.org to stamp big money out of politics. They are literally rubber stamping their cash with anti-corruption messages like ""Not to be used for buying elections"" unleashing a visual, symbolic blitz through the actual source of corruption.  Every stamped bill is seen by approximately 900 people, culminating into an accelerating display of public support to get big money out of politics

Merely on an anecdotal level, the gyrocopter method was a brilliant display of non-violent activism. It was simply captivating. Within 24 hours of the event, ""campaign finance"" was mentioned on broadcast television about 3,000 times. But we need to keep the momentum going.

Through diverse and inventive tactics, the anti-corruption movement will not cease speaking out about pay-to-play politics and dollar-driven legislators until we see real changes. The people of this country need to unite in promoting a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's Buckley v. Valeo and Citizens United v. FEC ruling, which opened the floodgates to unrestricted special interest money in our elections. And we need to do it quick -- before corporations and ultra-wealthy groups completely hijack our political system. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

Israel evacuated Israeli citizens and gay parents with their infants on April 27.

TEL AVIV -- When a deadly earthquake struck Nepal on Saturday, killing thousands and leaving millions displaced, an Israeli couple more than 3,000 miles away felt like their world would come crashing down too. 

They couldn’t get in touch with their Indian surrogate, Sanju, eight months pregnant with their twins in Kathmandu. The expectant fathers feared the worst.

Yoav Elani and his partner of 14 years, Moran Ben-Dror, have long dreamed of the day they would become fathers. But Israel greatly restricts gay couples from adopting or using Israeli surrogates, pushing many hopeful parents to seek other options abroad.

“We’ve been trying for seven years,” said Elani, sitting next to his partner in their apartment as the television flashed video of evacuated Israelis, including gay parents with newborns, arriving at Ben Gurion Airport. “We’ve had ups and downs, and a fucking earthquake. When we finally get to meet our babies, we’re just going to sit down and cry.”


Yoav Elani and his partner of 14 years, Moran Ben-Dror, embrace in their Tel Aviv apartment.

As the couple anxiously waits, hoping Israel will allow Sanju and other surrogates to come to Israel to give birth to Israeli babies, the natural disaster has brought unexpected attention to Israeli gay rights, as well as the controversy surrounding commercial surrogacy. 

While Israel has prided itself on being a gay-friendly nation, with Tel Aviv considered one of the top “gay capitals” in the world, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Israelis say there’s still a long road ahead. With marriage closely guarded by religious institutions in Israel, gay marriage is not allowed (although gay marriages conducted outside Israel are recognized by the state) and neither is the use of surrogates in Israel for gay couples.

And unlike lesbians in Israel, who can get pregnant with the help of a sperm bank, gay men are left with few options to start a family. As such, Nepal has become a major destination for gay single men and couples hoping to have children of their own. 

Nepal is one of only a few countries worldwide allowing surrogacy services to gay couples, but only via foreign, not Nepalese, surrogates. Recently, Thailand, India and Nepal changed surrogacy laws after a series of incidents in which surrogates or surrogate-born children were neglected and exploited.

With India's 2013 ban on individuals and gay couples seeking surrogacy services came uproar over homophobia. Many Indian surrogates then sought work in Nepal. 

But with Nepal’s disaster and crippling humanitarian crisis comes uncertainty for hopeful and expectant Israeli parents who have relied on surrogacy services in Nepal. The number of casualties in Nepal continues to rise dramatically, with at least 5,489 confirmed dead as of Thursday morning, and thousands more injured and missing. The death toll could climb as high as 10,000. 


A woman looks at damaged buildings in Khokana, a village dating back hundreds of years, on the outskirts of Kathmandu on April 29, 2015, following a 7.8 magnitude earthquake which struck the Himalayan nation on April 25.

Many Indian surrogates carrying Israeli babies have been forced outside of centers and hospitals -- afraid of being crushed indoors by aftershocks -- along with scores of terrified Nepalese mothers and their newly arrived “earthquake babies.” 

“We are addressing the prime minister and the government of Israel,” Elani said. “We’re begging: Save our children.”

Some critics have slammed commercial surrogacy in less-developed countries as unethical, labeling the process as ""womb trafficking"" in which rich foreigners exploit women. 

While Israeli parents using surrogates insist the women are well-treated (The WorldPost has not been able to independently verify this information yet), they say they likely wouldn’t have to use surrogacy services abroad if Israel just legalized the process for gay families. 

Elani and Ben Dror say they Skyped with Sanju for the first time just before the earthquake.


An ultrasound shows one of Yoav Elani's and Moran Ben-Dror's babies, being carried by an Indian surrogate, several weeks before the devastating earthquake hit Nepal.

“I tried to keep my tears bottled up,” Elani said, explaining how their surrogate showed them her round belly with their twins inside. “There’s no way in the world that we would be ever able to show enough gratitude.” 

They hope that both she and her 11-year-old son will be able to come to Israel for the birth, along with the other Indian surrogate mothers. But many of them do not have passports, and the bureaucratic hurdles to get them to Israel are high. 

Elani and Ben-Dror fear what will happen if the mothers stay in Nepal, where many hospital and clinics are destroyed or overwhelmed with desperate people in need of medical care. Millions in Nepal are now facing hunger, homelessness and threat of disease with the rainy season just around the corner. Israel has opened up an emergency clinic in Kathmandu with at least 200 doctors and emergency specialists, but it can't meet the high need. 

Gay Israelis hoping to have children may have to turn elsewhere for surrogates. Israeli couples interviewed by The WorldPost listed a few other countries besides Nepal, including the United States and Mexico, as possible places to hire surrogates, but stressed that the process there was often incredibly expensive and logistically challenging.

Hiring an Indian surrogate through an agency in Nepal usually costs between $60,000 and $80,000, according to Israelis familiar with the process. It could cost up to $150,000 in the United States. 

Alternatively, some gay couples or single gay men in Israel choose to team up with a lesbian or a straight woman who is then legally the mother of their children. But for some aspiring parents, the idea of co-parenting with another person outside the relationship is not ideal. Nepal offered a solution. 


Etai Pinkas Arad with husband, Yoav, and children Noah, Gal and Or, who were born with the help of surrogate mothers in India and Thailand.

“The Nepal tragedy adds to the many aspects of this story,” explained Etai Pinkas Arad, a Tel Aviv City Council member and LGBT rights activist. “Starting with the fate of the surrogate mothers -- the ones who didn’t give birth yet who are stuck there -- and the fact that this is almost the only option [for gay Israelis].""

For years, Arad has urged the state to ensure greater freedoms like marriage and surrogacy equality. He and his husband, Yoav, who were married in Toronto 10 years ago, have fathered three children with the help of surrogates in India and Thailand.

He says he sees LGBT rights improving in Israel and that the government is serious about change, but stresses it could take years before there is real equality. Despite Israel’s reputation as a gay-friendly state, Arad’s campaign faces great political and religious opposition. 

“The state shouldn’t formally recognize [homosexuality],” Bezalel Smotrich, a high-ranking Knesset member of the religious Zionist settler Jewish Home Party who has described himself as a “proud homophobe,” told The WorldPost. ""So we won’t allow Israel to recognize surrogacy for same sex-couples."" In 2006, he helped organize an anti-gay rally in Jerusalem where hundreds of participants marched with donkeys and goats, comparing gay Israelis to ""beasts.""

Expectant father Ben-Dror says Israel is divided. “On the one hand, we’re 100 percent pro-gay,” he explained, a gay pride flag hanging on a shelf behind him. ""But then we have the [Chief] Rabbinate, and they don’t know how to make the gay thing fit,"" he added, referring to Israel's state religious authority.

Even though using Israeli surrogates is forbidden for the gay community here, the state still provides rights like paternity leave for gay parents who have opted to hire foreign surrogates. 


Single dad Yossi Filiba with his month-old daughter Naama at their home in Tel Aviv.

Such laws mean everything to new parents like Yossi Filiba, a single father who was in Kathmandu with his three-week-old daughter, Naama, when the earthquake hit. He says he thinks Israeli society will eventually gravitate toward acceptance of gay parents. When he walks down his street in Tel Aviv, he says, he sees gay and lesbian families of all sorts, with their children conceived in a myriad of ways. 

“We always walk a tight rope in Israel between the state and the religion,” Filiba explained, as his tiny daughter cooed in her purple onesie. Just days ago, they were sleeping outside as the earth shook. “There’s a lot of criticism about surrogacy. But I think that in the last few years, the concept of families is changing.”

He gently touched his daughter’s face, captivated. 

“She has my lips and eyes,” he said. “We are the same. She’s my family.”


Yossi Filiba carries his newborn daughter after landing at Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv on April 28, following his repatriation from the quake-hit Nepal. Israel began repatriating its nationals from Nepal on April 27, including two groups of babies born to surrogate mothers in Kathmandu whose fathers are gay Israelis.

The Marvel and Disney sequel earned a staggering $187.7 million in its debut weekend, making it the second biggest U.S. opening of all time according to Rentrak estimates Sunday.

But ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" failed to top the all-time record of the first film's $207.4 million debut in 2012. Although ""Ultron"" was the only new film in wide release this weekend, it had some significant small screen competition: The Kentucky Derby, the NBA playoffs, and the Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao fight.

Numbers could shift by the time Monday actuals roll in, but it seems the robust counter-programming may have blockaded another  record for Marvel and Disney.

Still, for Disney's head of distribution Dave Hollis, the weekend was a ""spectacular result.""

Playing on 4,276 screens, the audiences for ""Ultron's"" debut were 59 percent male and 41 percent under the age of 25.

""We're in rare air here,"" said Hollis. ""Having the second biggest opening weekend in the history of the movie business is always going to be something you walk away overwhelmingly happy with. The momentum of the brand for Marvel at this point is really something to take a step back and admire.""

Marvel and Disney now boast the top three opening weekends of all time with ""Avengers"" and its sequel taking the top two slots and ""Iron Man 3"" in third place.

Hollis said this is ""confirmation"" that these films are ""bringing a completely different kind of filmmaking to cinema. They're creating events and characters and building worlds in a way that is drawing the attention of huge crowds.""

Rentrak's Senior Media Analyst Paul Dergarabedian agreed that the failure to top the first film is ""in no way"" a disappointment.

""You have to put this into perspective. Considering the level of competition this weekend in the sporting world, it shows that movie going holds its own against all other options,"" he said.

Also, while the first film's $207.4 million haul might just seem like a new benchmark to hit, Dergarabedian was quick to point out that opening above $200 million was ""literally like breaking the box office sound barrier.""

Instead of a new industry standard, a $200 million opening might continue to be an industry rarity.

""Ultron's"" future success is not in doubt either.

""These other options were single events. 'Avengers' has a very long playing time. This is a journey to $1 billion and beyond,"" he said.

The rest of the top five was populated with holdovers, ""The Age of Adaline,"" ''Furious 7,"" ''Paul Blart: Mall Cop,"" and the animated ""Home.""

Officer Brian Moore, 25, remained in critical but stable condition at Jamaica Hospital, a spokeswoman for the New York Police Department said.

Police identified the suspect in the shooting in the New York borough of Queens on Saturday as Demetrius Blackwell, 35. He was arrested soon after the shooting and on Sunday he was charged with attempted murder, assault and two counts of criminal possession of a weapon, the NYPD said.

The shooting took place five months after the fatal ambush of two uniformed New York City police officers in Brooklyn. The gunman in that case had said he wanted to avenge black men killed in confrontations with white officers.

The shooting of Moore, who is white, initially sparked concern it was a replay of the Brooklyn murders. It occurred as tensions are running high in Baltimore over the death last month of a black man from injuries sustained while in police custody.

But, asked at a news conference if the suspect expressed any anti-police sentiment or was influenced by recent demonstrations against police, Police Commissioner William Bratton said there was no indication of that.

""We haven't identified any activity on his part whatsoever on social media,"" he told reporters about two hours after the shooting.

Moore is the fifth New York City officer shot in five months, police said.

Bratton said Blackwell shot at Moore and another officer at about 6:15 p.m. on Saturday while they were in their car in a middle-class Queens neighborhood.

The officers were trying to question Blackwell, who had an extensive criminal background, after they observed him appearing to adjust an object in his waistband, Bratton said.

Blackwell ""removed a firearm from his waistband and ... fired several times into the vehicle,"" Bratton said, adding that both officers were still seated in the car and did not have a chance to get out or return fire.

Police said on Sunday that Blackwell was wanted on outstanding charges from previous criminal activity including grand larceny, criminal possession of a weapon and menacing.

The December shooting took place at a time when New York Mayor Bill de Blasio's relations with city police were at a low point over what was perceived to be the mayor's failure to support law enforcement during a wave of anti-police protests late last year.

Hundreds of officers turned their backs when de Blasio delivered a eulogy at one of the officer's funerals.

""The fact is, the president needs her help in order to get Democrats, those in the House and Senate, to get this passed,"" Boehner said in an interview on NBC's ""Meet The Press."" 

""She can't sit on the sidelines and let the president swing in the wind here,"" he said.

Obama has been lobbying congressional Democrats for weeks to give him ""fast-track"" authority, which would let him negotiate a massive trade deal -- known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- that Congress could only approve or disapprove in an up-or-down vote, versus amending it. 

Republicans and some Democrats are supportive, but many liberal Democrats are opposed out of fear that the deal would outsource U.S. jobs. In particular, House Democrats may have the votes to sink the whole thing if Obama can't get them on board.

Clinton has been mum on the issue, and Boehner says it's time for her to start talking.

When asked by NBC's Chuck Todd if Clinton needs to be more engaged, Boehner replied, ""I do.""

""Hillary Clinton was for trade promotion authority. Hillary Clinton is for the trade bill with the Asians.

ea62bf075a133f76332c47400f0f9110,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dean-baker/hit-job-daniel-disalvo-on_b_7199800.html,Hit Job: Daniel DiSalvo on Public Sector Unions,"Daniel DiSalvo doesn't like public sector unions. That is the main takeaway from Government Against Itself (Oxford University Press) DiSalvo's new book on public sector unions. In the course of reading the book they are likely to conclude that he is not especially fond of unions or workers in general. He also doesn't like Social Security and Medicare. He even manages to get in a drive-by directed at Senator Elizabeth Warren.

But the main villain of the book is clearly public sector unions. DiSalvo paints a dark conspiracy where public sector unions push for ever higher pay and benefits, work rules that allow for endless loafing on the job, and disciplinary policies that prevent even the most incompetent from being fired. High costs and low productivity strain public budgets, but the political power of public sector unions prevents effective steps to counter their abuses. Since the unions are such large donors to political campaigns, politicians can't stand up to them. It's a moving story; the data just don't quite fit the picture.

Before getting into the details, I will follow DiSalvo's example and give some personal biography. My mother worked for 30 years in the Illinois Department of Public Aid. Much of this time she was a member of AFSCME, however she did move up to a supervisor position, thereby becoming management. She is now living on her pension from the state. When I was a grad student in Michigan, as a teaching assistant I was a member of the Michigan Federation of Teachers. The Center for Economic and Policy Research, where I am co-director, gets about 10 percent of its funding from unions, roughly half of which is from public sector unions. Now, let's get back to the story. 

Pensions

DiSalvo's begins his book with horror stories about three relatively young retirees from public sector jobs, all of whom enjoy comfortable pensions. He then tells us that the best estimate of the unfunded liability of the public pension system is $3.2 trillion (page 3), which he adds is approximately 21 percent of GDP. (Fortunately, his estimate of the shortfall had fallen to $2.7 trillion and 17 percent of GDP by page 155.) These numbers undoubtedly sounds pretty scary, but of course these liabilities refer to a 30-year pension planning period, not a single year. Over that time period, DiSalvo's $3.2 trillion figure is equal to a bit less than 0.8 percent of the discounted value of GDP.   

But wait, it gets less scary. DiSalvo's calculations use a rate of discount that is far below the expected and historic return on pension fund assets. If future liabilities are discounted using the expected return on pension fund assets, the cumulative shortfall is roughly $1 trillion, according to the Pew Research Center. This would come to roughly 0.25 percent of GDP over the 30-year planning period. That is not a trivial sum, but probably not the sort of thing that need keep us awake at night. By comparison, the increase in military spending associated with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan was roughly 1.6 percent of GDP at its peak. 

Furthermore, the tales of lavish pensions for early retirees are the exceptions, as can be easily discovered.  The average benefit for a retired New York (non-uniform) state public employee in 2014 was $21,300. Non-uniform Detroit city workers got average benefits of $19,200 before the bankruptcy agreement.  As a result of the bankruptcy, they took a 4.5 percent cut in pensions, and gave up their cost of living adjustment (COLA). The loss of the COLA will lead to cuts of close to 50 percent after 25 years. Retired public employees in Illinois get an average pension of $32,200. Sound generous? These workers don't get Social Security so this will be the bulk of the retirement income for most of these workers. 

There are cases where workers are able to retire early due to 25 years or 30 years and out clauses and these provide the poster children for DiSalvo. Most public sector employees don't start their work at age 20. The vast majority of non-uniform public sector employees don't start collecting their benefits until they are over age 60. Police and fire fighters generally are able to retire with relatively generous pensions in their fifties. But these are dangerous and often physically demanding jobs where we probably would not want people working into their sixties.      

There are certainly state and local governments with pensions that are seriously underfunded, but it is hard to link this back to unions, as DiSalvo tries. Alicia Munnell, one of the country's leading retirement experts, found no statistically significant link between pension funding and the power of public sector unions. A quick look at the data shows that heavily unionized states can be found at both the top and bottom on the funding ratio spectrum. Illinois and New Jersey have seriously underfunded pensions, but New York and Washington rate near the top with 87 percent and 95 percent funding, respectively. By contrast, South Carolina and Virginia, both states without public employee unions, rank near the bottom with funding ratios of 65 percent. 

Compensation

If DiSalvo's attack on public employee unions and pensions falls short, he doesn't do much better with his wage story since it isn't clear what story he is trying to tell. When he lays out his main themes at the start of the book, he makes a point of telling us that public sector unions don't do much to advance equity. 

""While the benefits that public sector unions win for their members in terms of wages, health care, and pension benefits although substantial, tend to be smaller than those won by unions in the private sector, government unions don't do much for workers with high school diplomas and limited skills because they don't represent many of them (page 32)."" 

The problem with this picture is that virtually all the research on the relative compensation of public sector and private sector workers finds that less-educated workers in the public sector may enjoy a premium relative to their counterparts in the private sector. This is less obviously true for workers with college degrees and workers with advanced degrees are generally found to face a pay penalty compared with their counterparts in the private sector.

DiSalvo notes this fact in his longer discussion of wages in chapter 7, and in fact explicitly decries the compression of wages in the public sector. He argues that the compression of wages makes it more difficult for the public sector to get and retain high quality workers. That is a debatable point, but it goes directly opposite his earlier dismissal of public sector unions as a force promoting equity. In fact, there is little disagreement that workers with just high school degrees get better pay and benefits in the public sector on average than they would in the private sector. 

Looking at the question of pay comparability more generally, DiSalvo has a largely fair discussion of the literature on the topic. Most of the research finds that in straight pay, public sector workers face a modest penalty, but this is mostly or entirely offset by better benefits. We can beat this one up in various ways, but you can't make the story of comparability go away even if you can get the public sector pay being a bit higher or lower depending on the assumptions and the specific comparisons. 

DiSalvo does follow the direction of some research in arguing for a substantial premium based on greater job security and the value of a defined benefit pension. The case on job security is less compelling that DiSalvo implies. As he notes repeatedly, public sector employees are much more likely to be college grads than the population as whole. This means his comparisons of turnover or unemployment rates between public sector workers and the workforce as a whole are inappropriate. It is likely the case that there is less turnover and layoffs even when adjusting for education, experience and other factors, but the difference between the private and public sector would be considerably smaller. 

Also, as DeSalvo notes, private sector employees are likely to enjoy a premium in the form of more desirable workplaces. Public sector offices are usually functional and nothing more. Compare the Google campus to your favorite public sector office building. Where would you rather work?

But to really make a case that public sector workers are better paid than private sector workers it is necessary to assign a considerable value to the security offered by the defined benefit pensions that most public sector workers still enjoy and relatively few private sector workers now have. DeSalvo cites work by Andrew Biggs, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, which values a dollar placed in a defined benefit (DB) pension plan at more than three times the value of a dollar placed in a defined contribution plan. 

This calculation leads to a substantial compensation premium for public sector workers, but this is not due to what the government is paying, it is due to Biggs' calculation of the value of the benefit to workers. If the government paid the exact same amount for its workers' pensions, but put the money into a 401(k), by Biggs calculation the compensation premium for public sector employees would disappear. 

Biggs is undoubtedly right that the guaranteed benefit has considerable benefit to workers, even if there are reasons for questioning his exact calculation. But one of the ironies of this debate is that most of those arguing for reducing the power of public sector unions are also big proponents of defined contribution pensions. If they had their way, they would quickly eliminate the premium Biggs' finds, not by saving taxpayers money, but by providing less security for public sector workers. 

Historically DB pensions were thought to be a way of allocating risk to the party that can better bear it. It matters little to a state or local government if the stock market is down in a given year, as long as they correctly planned for its average return. On the other hand, it matters hugely to an individual worker if the market is down at the point at which they retire. It can mean a lower standard of living throughout their retirement years. By offering a DB pension, governments assume this risk. This has relatively little cost to the government, but provides a substantial benefit to workers. It would be unfortunate if political pressures forced an end to DB pensions in the public sector instead of finding a way to offer some equivalent security to workers in the private sector.    

Productivity and Efficiency

One of DiSalvo's main themes is that public sector unions impose work rules and protect seniority in ways that prevent governments from providing quality service. In particular, he focuses on teacher unions, telling readers;

""Take the clearest example of inefficiency: the inability of school administrators to fire incompetent teachers. Indeed, protecting such ineffective workers has the effect of weakening the overall public workforce. Stanford University economist Eric Hanushek found that if middling instructors could somehow replace the bottom 5 to 8 percent of American teachers, the United States would be catapulted to near the top of international math and science rankings (page 35)."" 

The problem with this story is that there are no unions to prevent the replacement of bad teachers in large sections of the country. States like Texas, which prohibit collective bargaining in the public sector, have not exactly catapulted to the top of international rankings in spite of the fact that unions are not preventing them from firing their worst performing teachers. There is a literature on the impact of unions on educational outcomes, and it is certainly possible that in some cases they have a negative impact, but the idea that teacher unions are the main factor preventing the United States from having outstanding educational outcomes is absurd on its face. 

It is also worth noting that countries that do consistently rank near the top in educational outcomes, such as Finland, have much higher unionization rates among their teachers than the United States. Clearly teacher unions are not inconsistent with high quality education. 

DiSalvo's poster child for unions bringing bad outcomes to schools is the confrontation between the Chicago Teachers Union and Mayor Rahm Emanuel in the fall of 2012. This confrontation led to a strike that was settled on terms relatively favorable to the teachers. While DiSalvo deplores the strike and the demands of the union, one important fact that he leaves out is that the teachers largely had the support of the parents. If Emanuel's proposals really promised better educational outcomes for students, he failed to convince the parents of this fact. 

Unions do ensure that workers cannot be dismissed without cause. This undoubtedly keeps some unqualified workers on the job longer than would otherwise be the case. On the other hand, it also protects qualified workers who might otherwise be dismissed for arbitrary reasons or personal disputes with their bosses. Lower turnover will generally be associated with higher productivity, as will an increased worker voice on the job. Preventing dismissal at will does not have to imply lower productivity.

Public Sector Unions and the Corruption of Democracy

Concerns about excess pay and low productivity are symptoms; the real problem in DiSalvo's view is that public sector unions undermine democracy. The issue is that the unions push governments for better pay and benefits. They then turn around and support candidates who will give them even better pay and benefits, with their power depending on the gains from their past contracts. DeSalvio sees this as a major corruption of democracy.

There are two obvious problems in this story. The first stems from the sums that provide the basis for DeSalvio's horror story. He highlights contributions from public sector unions in California, a state where they do have considerable power. His chart (Figure 4.10) shows public sector unions contributed roughly $24 million to candidates for the California legislature in 2012. (Table 4.4, on the previous page, puts the number at $7.6 million.) Should the fact that public sector unions can put such sums behind their favored candidates worry us?

In an era where we have billionaires who are prepared to spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions to support their favored candidates or their own campaigns, is it a distortion of democracy if unions representing hundreds of thousands of workers spend $24 million (using DiSalvo's higher number) to support their favored candidates? Since he has chosen to focus on California, in 2010 former Ebay CEO Meg Whitman ran for governor, spending $144 million of her own money. Rather than being concerned about the impact of these billionaires, DeSalvio wants us to be worried about public sector workers spending one sixth of this amount.

The other problem is with DeSalvio's logic about corruption. Of course there is a clear self-interest in public sector workers supporting the candidates who they expect will give them favorable treatment, but the situation of public sector workers is hardly unique. There are all manner of public contractors who routinely give large contributions to candidates with the expectation of favored treatment. In some cases this may be on broad policy issues, for example a charter school operator may donate money to candidates advocating school ""reform"" in the hope of boosting business.  

In other cases the contributions are more straightforward corruption, as when a contractor counts on the candidate they support to steer a major contract in their direction. The major difference between public sector unions and contractors in this story is that the contributions of the unions are fully transparent so that people like DiSalvo can report on them. As a result of recent court rulings, private contractors would have little difficulty hiding whatever sums they choose to contribute in support of their favored candidates. Nonetheless, DiSalvo is only worried about the impact of union contributions in distorting democracy.

This is not the only case where DiSalvo's concern over principles seems to be asymmetric. Like many conservatives, DiSalvo complains about contracts requiring workers to pay a representation fee to a union that represents their bargaining unit. He uses the phrase ""right to work,"" implying that this condition in a collective bargaining agreement somehow violates an individual worker's rights. 

Of course this one turns logic on its head. Employers impose all sorts of conditions on work. They set the hours workers must work, which they can change at will. They set dress codes, possibly requiring strict business attire or that workers wear silly uniforms. They can even tell workers how they are supposed to address customers or talk on the phone. In all of these cases, the answer to any worker who objects to the conditions set down by the employer is that the worker has the right to work somewhere else. If a worker doesn't like the terms set by the employer then they should look for another job.

DeSalvio only sees a problem when a condition is being set in a contract negotiated by co-workers. Then he would suddenly have us believe that there is a question of rights for the individual worker at stake. If the co-workers rather than the employer alone play a role in setting the terms of employment then there is suddenly an issue that a worker has the right to work at a particular workplace.

The actual issue here is one of freedom of contract. Can workers sign a contract that requires that everyone who benefits from union representation share in the cost of securing that benefit? DeSalvio argues that they can't, thereby taking away an important freedom. 

The same asymmetry comes up in his discussions on workers' pensions. In the last pages of the book he attacks the idea of pensions being sacrosanct, even in the context of a bankruptcy like the one in Detroit. A pension is part of a workers' pay in the form of deferred compensation. The workers in Detroit put in their time and they have good reason to expect that they will receive their pay. As a legal matter, unpaid wages always have top priority in a bankruptcy. In its bankruptcy, Detroit did not review old contracts to try to take back payments from city contractors. It did not review sales of land or other properties to see if it should retroactively charge more money. It is only public sector workers who are expected to give back what they have already earned.  

Democracy and Public Sector Unions 

In a book that seeks to make bold claims about the role of public sector unions in a democracy, it is striking that DiSalvo makes no use of international comparisons. Countries like Finland, Denmark, and Sweden, have much higher public sector unionization rates than the United States. These countries generally have high quality public services and good schools. They also have strong fiscal positions, with low deficits and low debt to GDP ratios, avoiding one of DiSalvo's main concerns. 

Clearly public sector unions have not led these countries on the road to ruin. If there is some inherent conflict between public sector unions and democracy it would be striking if it only seems to show up in the United States. A serious work on the topic of the relationship of public sector unions to democracy would have to explain why they seem to be a problem in some places, as claimed by DiSalvo for the United States, but don't appear to cause the same problems elsewhere.

Stepping back from this book, the attack on public sector unions in recent years must be understood in its larger political context. Since the election of President Reagan in 1980, the conservative movement has aggressively sought to destroy all the institutional supports for progressive politics in the United States. This drive placed unions directly in the crosshairs. 

They pushed a variety of policies designed to weaken private sector unions both directly and indirectly. The direct efforts included a weakening of the National Labor Relations Board and legitimizing the firing of striking workers, reducing the effectiveness of unions' most important weapon. Indirect policies include the deregulation of heavily unionized industries, such as telecommunications, airlines, and trucking, trade policies designed to put heavily unionized industries in direct competition with low-paid workers in the developing world, and macroeconomic policies that keep the unemployment rate higher than in prior decades. 

This effort by the right has yielded fruit in the form of a sharply diminished role for private sector unions, which now represent just 7.4 percent of the private sector workforce. Having largely succeeded in their attack on private sector unions, the right is now pointing its guns at public sector unions. While they undoubtedly would like to see public sector workers get lower pay and benefits and have reduced job security, it is at least as important to reduce their ability to support progressive candidates and political movements. 

Imagine what elections in even the bluest states would look like if there were no public sector unions to counter the money of billionaires like the Koch brothers? These states would have many fewer Democratic office holders and the ones that were elected would look much more like Republicans, at least on economic issues. 

The major political efforts of the last two decades at both the state and national levels would be almost nowhere without the backing of public sector unions. It's difficult to imagine that any of the state or local minimum wage drives would have succeeded without the support of public sector unions. The same applies to efforts to guarantee benefits like paid family leave or paid sick days. And no one can believe that the Affordable Care Act would have passed without the support it received from the labor movement, including public sector unions.

In all of these cases public sector unions pushed for policies that benefited workers more generally. For the most part their members already had the gains they sought to secure for other workers. This wasn't altruism on the part of public sector unions. These are examples of unions acting with foresight, recognizing that it will not be possible to maintain good pay and benefits for public sector workers in a context where private sector workers are poorly paid and without benefits.

This is the main reason why the right wants to eviscerate public sector unions. It is important for progressives everywhere to understand this fact. There are certainly serious grounds for complaints against public sector unions. There are corrupt officials and time-serving bureaucrats, as is the case with any large institutional structure. But without public sector unions, American democracy would be in a much more dismal state. No progressive should have any doubt on this point. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

A prominent and popular Jewish composer, he fled to Paris in 1933. Well known for his theater hits, such as The Threepenny Opera and Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, he soon headed to the safety of New York. 

In 1937, the Manhattan Opera House debuted his lavish production The Eternal Road, an opera-oratorio in four acts, with libretto by Franz Werfel, created to alert the public to Hitler's persecution of the Jews.

The U.S. premiere of the new concert adaptation, reconceived as The Road of Promise,  an oratorio in 14 scenes, is led by Tony-winning conductor/director Ted Sperling, artistic director of The Collegiate Chorale, and features the Orchestra of St. Luke's.

It plays May 6 and 7 at Carnegie Hall in New York.

The story: Modern European Jews take shelter in a synagogue under threat from mobs outside. They listen to stories of the Old Testament, including a 13-year-old boy, to sustain the community's strength. The youngster learns of his heritage and faith from the rabbi and emerges as the new hope for his people. 

Renowned singers include Ron Rifkin, Anthony Dean Griffey, Mark Delavan, Philip Cutlip, AJ Glueckert and Lotte Lenya Competition finalists/winners Lauren Michelle, Megan Marino and Justin Hopkins.

Ted Sperling discussed the importance of re-staging Weill's Eternal Road:

Why select this piece? Does it again speak to the rising anti-Semitism in Europe?

TS: We're doing this primarily for musical reasons, but of course, the current events in Europe make its message even more relevant than we expected when it was initially scheduled. This is a major piece by a major composer that has not really had its day in the sun. We're looking forward to bringing it to New York audiences and then to a worldwide audience through the recording by Parma/Navano Records.

Where does the work fit in the Kurt Weill oeuvre?

TS: To me, it feels like a transitional work for Weill. It has an operatic aesthetic, similar to what you hear in Mahagonny, but it also has elements that hint at the Broadway works to come.

What does Collegiate Chorale add to such a work?

TS: We bring a chorus of 150 voices, which is necessary to bring these large double choruses to life. We also have assembled a stellar cast of singers and actors, many of whom have a close connection with the music of Kurt Weill. We're delighted to be working with the Orchestra of St. Luke's, New York's premier orchestra for concerts like these. And we are collaborating with Wendall Harrington, the premiere projection designer, to paint the walls of the hall with images from the stories being told.

 What's singular about this particular Weill work?

TS: The original production of this piece, in 1937, was the most ambitious stage spectacle ever produced in New York, with a five-level set and a cast of nearly 250. It was a critical and popular success, but was too expensive to run. Even after more than 150 nearly sold-out performances, it bankrupted its producer.

 Lately, the Collegiate Chorale has been performing at Carnegie Hall. Is that now your permanent venue?

TS: Our most recent unusual venue was the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum, where we performed the New York City premiere of Battle Hymns. We expect to continue to perform at Carnegie Hall, as well as City Center, Lincoln Center, and unconventional venues that we're investigating right now.

Around 70% of college graduates have student loan debt. Most people finish school with around $30,000 in loans and expect to pay them off in around 10 years. Everyone understands what you're going through. For most people who earn a college degree, student loans are just a fact of life.
 
2. It can be great for your credit score.
Your credit history will follow you for life. Lenders use your score to evaluate what kind of risk you are, and it can determine what credit opportunities are available to you and what kind of interest rates you qualify for. People with no, or poor, credit history have trouble securing favorable interest rates and many don't qualify for auto and home loans at all.
Luckily, paying down your student loans over time will help build a positive credit history, and raise your score. This can pay off in a big way by opening up borrowing opportunities and access to the lowest interest rates. That's right. When you buy a house, you may be thanking your student loans for a lifetime of lower mortgage payments.
 
3. It doesn't have to take forever.
If paying off your loans as fast as possible is important to you, there's no reason you can't make it happen. Last year, 22 year old Jordan Arnold paid off his $23,150 student loan debt just 10 months after graduating! He prioritized repayment by minimizing living expenses, taking a second job, and making payments early before interest started accruing. It takes hard work and smart budgeting, but it's entirely possible to be debt free before 25.
 
4. You're not stuck with your current terms. 
Explosive growth in student loan refinancing, combined with historically low market rates, means you have a lot of options. If you're not happy with the terms of your loan, shop around. There are many qualified private lenders ready to help you refinance and lower your payments. Nothing is set in stone, and you don't need to be married to your original loan. Especially when a rising credit score qualifies you for much better interest rates through a private lender.
 
 
5. You got to go to college!
Your student loans weren't for nothing, you got to go to college. College is the best time of many people's lives. You made lasting memories, lifelong friends, and may have even met your spouse. Indeed, almost 30% of married couples attended the same college. On top of that, you increased your earning potential by A LOT. A college degree increases in value every generation, and today's college graduate earns an average of $17,500 more annually than someone with only a high school diploma.
Paying off student loans may seem daunting, but when loans are managed effectively, they are more than worth it for most borrowers. We've all (mostly) been there, and if you get overwhelmed, don't forget that there are lots of options to help you manage and reduce your payments.

An official from South Korea's Unification Ministry, which handles affairs with North Korea, said his department was still trying to gather information on Won Moon Joo's travels and the circumstances of his arrest. ""Our judgment is that Joo is being held in North Korea, but we are still trying to confirm the details of how he got arrested,"" he said on condition of anonymity, citing office rules.

North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said Saturday that Joo was arrested on April 22 after trying to illegally enter North Korea by crossing the Amnok River from the Chinese border town of Dandong.

A spokesman for New York University, John Beckman, confirmed that Joo was a junior at NYU's Stern School of Business, but that he was not taking classes this semester and the university was unaware of his travels. He said the university was in touch with the U.S. State Department and the South Korean Embassy.

North Korea has occasionally detained South Koreans, Americans and other foreigners, often on accusations of spying, in what analysts say are attempts to wrest outside concessions.

In March, North Korea announced that it had detained two South Korean citizens over alleged espionage. It has been holding another South Korean man since late 2013 on suspicion of spying and allegedly trying to set up underground churches in the North. He was sentenced last year to life in prison with hard labor.

Also last year, the North released three Americans — two of whom entered the country on tourist visas — and Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American missionary who was convicted of ""anti-state"" crimes.-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said Sunday that if he becomes president in 2016, he will bring ""a real political shake-up"" that lifts the nation's poorest while stemming the proliferation of millionaires and billionaires. 

In other words, he said he wants to make America look more like Scandinavia.

During an interview on ABC's ""This Week,"" host George Stephanopoulos asked the 73-year-old Vermont senator if it's really possible for someone like him to be elected president. Sanders, who identifies as a democratic socialist, announced his White House run last week.

""Well, so long as we know what democratic socialism is,"" he said. ""And if we know that in countries, in Scandinavia, like Denmark, Norway, Sweden, they are very democratic countries, obviously. The voter turnout is a lot higher than it is in the United States. In those countries, health care is the right of all people. And in those countries, college education, graduate school is free.""

When Stephanopoulos said Republicans were likely to jump all over Sanders for saying the U.S. should be more like Scandinavia, the senator said he has no problem with that.

""That's right. And what's wrong with that?"" Sanders said. ""What's wrong when you have more income and wealth equality?  What's wrong when they have a stronger middle class in many ways than we do, higher minimum wage than we do, and they are stronger on the environment than we do?""

""The fact of the matter is, we do a lot in our country, which is good,"" he added. ""But we can learn from other countries.""

As The Huffington Post's Jonathan Cohn notes, there's an important distinction between a democratic socialist and what many Americans may think of when they hear the word ""socialist."" Democratic socialism is a milder, more aspirational form of the ideology. Instead of actively pursuing the goal of government running large industries, a democratic socialist focuses on far less radical objectives, like making the welfare state more generous and limiting the influence of money on politics.

When asked about taking on Hillary Clinton, Sanders said he's the only candidate focused on the fact that the top 1 percent of Americans has almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. He noted that he raised $1.5 million on the first day of his campaign. The average contribution? $43.

""Nobody thought that I would be elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont. Very few people thought that I would beat an incumbent Republican to become United States congressman from Vermont by 16 points. And people weren't so sure I could beat the richest person in Vermont to become a United States senator,"" Sanders said.

But it does have everything to do with your poor habits.

So it’s not surprising that you struggle each day to build your business. Your day is peppered with habits that are not helping you but hurting you:


Bad eating habits.
A misguided morning ritual.
No clue what a habit is.


At this rate, you will burn out before your company does. But there is hope – the solution is to replace those bad habits with good ones. Are you ready?

Developing a Good Habit Is a Nightmare

Have you ever wondered why you have so many bad habits? Why do you do the bad things you know are bad for you like overeating and smoking? 

Wikipedia explains that a habit is, “the process by which behavior, through repetition, becomes automatic or habitual.”

So, for the most part, your habits have been nurtured by you over a period of time. But how do you stop nurturing bad habits and start building good habits? 

It’s not easy, but the two most important items are: commitment and baby steps:


Commit to doing something small, like Yoga for 10 minutes Monday - Friday.
Commit to eating a healthy breakfast on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
Commit to doing your most creative work between 6 - 7 a.m. Monday and Tuesday.


As these habits begin to become easier and more automatic, you can increase the frequency. You can either increase the time you dedicate or you can increase the number of days.

The Morning Ritual Is Just Plain Stupid

So what is this thing called the Morning Ritual? We all have one, it’s basically a set of habits that you do every morning.

Now, what you do in a morning ritual will set up your day for success or failure.

A stressful morning ritual might look like this – rush to take a shower, yell at the kids to get dressed for school and swallow a few gulps of coffee while you run out the door.

This is the morning ritual that I had for years and it brought me nothing but stress, fatigue and an upset stomach.

But after reading Hal Elrod’s book the Morning Miracle I realized that my mornings should fuel me not rob me of energy.

So I committed to a new morning ritual that would not only fuel me but allow me to power through my busy day:


Get up at 4:00-ish using the Sleep Cycle app.
Drink a hot cup of water with lemon and honey.
Yoga for 20 minutes.
Write in my Five Minute Journal.
Meditate for seven minutes.
Shower and get dressed.
Make the family breakfast and I eat oatmeal with nuts and fruits.


By building this new morning ritual, I have the energy and clarity to better manage my hectic day.

Why The Foods You Eat Will Destroy You

It’s no secreted that your diet is critical to your success.

But your day is full of meetings and project deadlines so you grab what’s available – your fourth cup of coffee, a donut from five hours ago, and a bag of chips. 

While these foods may satisfy your initial craving, it does very little for your energy levels. In fact, these foods rob your body of its energy. 

Neil Patel, of Nutritional Resource, explains “…there are a great number of foods that give you just what you need to be healthy and fit.”

Patel lists 15 foods that are designed to keep your energy levels up:


Chicken breasts
Eggs
Salmon
Dairy milk
Greek yogurt
Shrimp
Almond milk
Almonds
Oats
Potatoes
Kale
Blueberries
Garlic
Cinnamon
Dark chocolate


Yes, these foods are amazing but at the end of the day it’s just not about these 15 foods. It’s about making small changes that will lead to a healthier diet. One that give you the energy to power through your day.

Question: We all have bad habits it’s part of being human but in order to grow we need good habits. What habits do you want to change today?

Part 1 of this post challenged public and private investors to build infrastructure for a 21st century clean energy economy rather than repairing and expanding infrastructure designed for fossil fuels. Part 2 describes how the evolution of a clean energy economy is putting increased pressure conventional electric utilities and their regulators.



When Elon Musk introduced the latest in battery technology last week, it was a Steve Jobs moment. Musk wants to do for energy technology what Jobs did for information technology: Revolutionize it.

In an auditorium whose lights and media equipment were powered by sunlight stored in his latest invention, Musk unveiled wall-mounted and surprisingly affordable battery packs as elegant-looking as Apple's iPhone (see the unit in the photo with one of Musk's electric vehicles). They even come in a choice of colors. 

The electric battery was invented more than 200 years ago. In modern times, it has been the weak link in applications such as electric vehicles and energy storage; by most accounts the technology still has a distance to go before it is optimized for applications like these. Musk's vision is to allow households and communities to become as independent from the aging electric grid as smart-phone users are from landlines. In customary big-think, he says that two billion of the devices could eliminate the world's use of carbon fuels, slow down climate change and give reliable electric power to people in less-developed countries. 

Last week's rollout was a happy event for renewable energy enthusiasts, but it was another rude reminder for America's electric utilities and regulators that their business and regulatory models lag years behind our rapidly emerging clean energy technologies. It's as though Musk unveiled a new automobile that can travel safely at 250 miles an hour while the nation's speed limits are stuck at 55. Innovation is not going to slow down so regulators can catch up.

Some of the challenges that utility regulators face can be described with several terms that are familier in policy circles.   

The first term is load defection. It is what occurs when customers put solar panels on their roofs to produce more of their own electricity and buy less of it from their utility. These distributed solar systems grew more than 400 percent between 2010 and 2014 according to the Energy Information Administration. Solar homes usually use the conventional grid as backup when the sun doesn't shine; in many states, homeowners can sell or ""net meter"" excess power back to their utilities when they produce more than they use.  

An even more disruptive development is grid defection. Batteries that do a good job storing power are one of the advances that will enable households and communities to divorce themselves entirely from the conventional electric system. Navigant Research reports there is growing interest in micro-grids -- small electric generation and distribution systems that can allow a community or large institution to separate from the utility system during a power outage, or to become completely independent of the grid. Navigant predicts the micro-grid market will grow to $20 billion by 2020.  

A third issue has to do with stranded assets in the fossil energy sector. These are assets that end up unused and investments whose returns are not fully realized. An example of stranded assets are coal plants that shut down before the end of their useful lives because they cannot compete with cleaner fuels like natural gas, or because of the cost to comply with regulatory constraints on pollution. 

Investments in oil and gas wells, pipelines and related infrastructure could become stranded if it becomes necessary to limit fossil energy production to prevent climate change from growing worse. Investments in new electric transmission and distribution lines could become stranded by a proliferation of micro-grids and distributed power generation. 

The flip side of stranded assets is committed carbon. If we were to build new pipelines and fossil-fired power plants and insist on using them until the end of their design lives, they lock us in to future carbon pollution unless acceptable technical solutions such as carbon capture and sequestration can be devised. 

Dealing with these trends and issues requires forward thinking by investors, power companies, legislatures and regulators. That is difficult because we do not have a consensus national energy plan to provide reasonable certainty about which investments will pay off. Investment also would be safer if Congress established a price on carbon pollution to give accurate market signals about which resources and technologies are most competitive in a carbon-constrained world. It seems unlikely we will get these tools in today's political environment, but without them we will see more false starts, more wasted money and more committed carbon in the years ahead. In a more rational world, the hundreds of billions of dollars we must spend to modernize America's energy systems would not only accommodate the clean energy revolution; they would empower it. 

Our old electric power system has been called the greatest engineering achievement of the 20th century. The innovations by the many ingenious pioneers of the past contributed to a remarkable system that delivers modern electricity to virtually every part of America. The reinvention of that system, led by a new generation of pioneers, has the potential to become one of the greatest engineering achievements of the 21st century. But only if we are smart enough to let it happen. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

Getting a degree is something to be proud of, however, academic success does not always lead to fiscal maturity. Many graduates have accumulated a large debt burden, and it’s important for parents to keep tabs on whether or not their children are keeping up with loan payments.
Furthermore, parents might be even able to help find ways to reduce their child’s debt through loan forgiveness plans or refinancing.
Impact On Students & Families
According to a recent study released by Junior Achievement and PwC, nearly one in four Millennials believe their college loans will be forgiven. Some other key findings of the study revealed:

Sixty percent of Millennials base their school choice on financial aid factors. Sixty-two percent did not attend their first college of choice due to high costs.
For Millennials ages 18-29, the top financial worries are college tuition and student loan debt. Over 20% said that it was their family’s biggest money concern.
One-third of those surveyed pay over $300 per month in loans, and a significant number pay over $1000 each month.

The study clearly shows that higher education debt impacts the lives of many families. In fact, according to the Pew Research Center, over the past few years the average amount of student debt has grown to nearly $30,000.
The hidden danger to parents is that some graduates simply neglect to pay off their loans. They might forget, or they just might ignore their responsibility. Unfortunately, many parents find out when things have gotten out of control. In these cases, accumulating interest and fees can dramatically increase the total amount that has to be paid. I
Dangers Of Not Paying Loan Obligations

The moment a person takes out a student loan, all the information about this debt is recorded by credit rating agencies. These agencies accumulate repayment data which helps determine a person’s credit score. Negative information stays on a person’s credit report for up to seven years or more. A bad credit rating can affect your child’s future ability to get a mortgage, car loan, credit card, or approval to rent a home or apartment.
Remember, if you co-signed the student loan agreement, any payment default could negatively affect your credit score as well and you could soon find yourself on the hook to make sure the loan gets paid. Also, if your child’s credit rating is damaged, you may have to co-sign if they wish to take out any kind of loan in the future.
Potential Loan Forgiveness
According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, loan forgiveness actually may be available for many borrowers. One out of four employees in the United States work for a public service employer. For those that hold student loan debt, they may be eligible for repayment benefits, such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness.
Consider Refinancing
Even if a person does not qualify for loan forgiveness, there are still ways to minimize payments. For example, if a debt carries high interest, refinancing the debt could save thousands of dollars over the lifetime of the loan. (Use our site Credible to easily see if you or your child could save by refinancing).
Don’t Be Afraid To Ask

Parents might be hesitant to ask about such a sensitive topic, but just because their child has graduated doesn’t mean they can’t benefit from parental guidance anymore. Sound personal financial management is a skill that requires practice and discipline. Perhaps many adults are in an economic mess because nobody ever taught them when they were young.
No matter what your situation, it pays to communicate with your child about their student loan status. Economic responsibilities can be challenging, and the advice of a wise parent makes a big difference.

Visit Credible to find out how much you or your children could save on their student loans by refinancing.

04b8a1112b55e38ce6ffdb9ae38fbb50,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/03/becki-norris-tsarnaev-teacher_n_7197072.html,Teacher Testifies So Dzhokhar Tsarnaev 'Knows That Someone Cares About Him',"BOSTON -- One of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's former middle school teachers wrote on Facebook this week that ""I still love him"" even though the convicted Boston Marathon bomber ""did the unforgivable."" 

It was the second time that Becki Norris spoke up for Tsarnaev, 21, on Wednesday. Earlier that day, the current Community Charter School of Cambridge principal testified in Tsarnaev's trial that when he was her seventh- and eighth-grade student, he was ""a really hard-working, smart kid"" with a seemingly bright future in front of him. 

Tsarnaev's life, of course, went in a vastly different direction than what Norris had forecast. He and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, detonated two bombs that killed three and wounded 264 others at the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013, and days later killed a police officer across the Charles River in Cambridge. 

""Over the past two years, I've discovered the painful truth that when you care deeply for someone, that doesn't stop even if they do unfathomably horrible things,"" Norris wrote on Facebook. ""Yes, he did the unforgivable. And yes, I still love him. And -- this one is hard to fathom, I know -- he still needs love.""

Her words qualified as a rare public display of support for Tsarnaev, one of the country's most vilified criminals. She sensed that many people might be puzzled by her position. 

""Ask yourself what you would think or do if someone you loved and cared about walked far, far down a deadly path,"" she said. 

Norris' entire message appears below beneath a photo of her notorious former pupil as a baby-faced youngster holding her newborn daughter. 

In at least one other example, a witness described on Facebook her intense feelings toward Tsarnaev -- though they were less complimentary. 

Bombing victim Rebekah Gregory shared a widely circulated letter denouncing Tsarnaev as ""a coward"" who wouldn't make eye contact with her while she testified in March about losing her leg from the attack. 

""[N]ow to me you're a nobody,"" Gregory wrote, ""and it is official that you have lost.""

The defense team is trying to save Tsarnaev from the death penalty. After a jury convicted him on 30 charges on April 8, the trial entered the penalty phase in which the same jurors will either sentence him to be executed or imprisoned without the possibility of parole. The prosecution has already made its case for the death penalty.

The defense has tried to convince jurors not to execute Tsarnaev, saying Tamerlan -- who died in a shootout with Watertown, Massachusetts, police -- was the mastermind of the bombing and coerced his younger brother into taking part.

Lawyers for Tsarnaev put several of his other teachers in the witness box, as well as two friends from University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, where he'd faltered academically but maintained a reputation as kind and generous friend. Relatives flown in from Russia are expected to testify on Monday.  

Tsarnaev was one of the best students and athletes in the Cambridge charter school until his mother removed him because of a dispute about the school uniform, Norris testified. From the stand, Norris made eye contact with Tsarnaev and they even smiled at each other

""He was already rightly found guilty. I testified to help the jury see why he might be spared the death penalty. I also hoped to show him, in spite of what he's done, that someone cares about him as a person,"" Norris wrote. ""I don't expect to ever see him again. I will hold onto those moments, and I hope he does too.""

In the spoof trailer, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) has everything going for her, namely an internship at a fashion magazine and a bunch of friends to order takeout with. But it wouldn't be a rom-com if she didn't happen to stumble upon the quirky, dog-walking Ultron at a park and fall hopelessly in love with him.

It happened to me quite recently after I wrote an article for Huffington Post, ""10 Hungarian Habits I Lost When I Moved to the US"", an article written for entertainment purposes for an American audience.

Somehow one of the Hungarian newspapers found my article, they translated it, shortened it and published it with a link to the original. The shortened translation was full of grammar and spelling mistakes. But I was still thinking positive. I felt that it is still a good way to reach a wider audience that the Hungarian readers would refer to the original article, have a smile out of it, and even find my more serious work on holistic health, healing and self-development.

Then I made a mistake: I read the comments. I was overwhelmed by the negative comments below the post: being called a trader, stupid, fake and words I can't even repeat. I was shocked. I got sad. I was in tears. 
I was in tears for hours. Then I stopped. 

I realized this was the nature of the social media and the internet.

Over the years I got stronger and stronger. I learned not to be influenced by the opinion of others so much. I learned that I can choose to be positive and happy.

Yet, at times I still let people put me down. This was one of those times. My old patterns came back and I felt like that kid again that was hated, not good enough and nobody wanted to play with in kindergarten. I let myself to be influenced by meaningless and negative comments by strangers releasing their own frustration on terrible translation of my article. I let myself to mope around, to cry, to feel ashamed and to regret everything from the past 32 years. 

Then I realized: I was only hurting myself.

I realized that I CAN choose otherwise. So I wiped down my tears. I moved on. I chose otherwise. I chose happiness instead.

But this likely not the last time this will happen. This is the nature of the internet. This is the nature of social media. This comes with putting yourself out there. You will receive negative and hurtful comments. Sometimes many. I am not talking about clever arguments, disagreements or constructive criticism, but unacceptable and hurtful words.

However, there are ways to deal with negative comments on the internet.

Don't read comments. This may be the best way to go. Put your message out there and just leave it. People can get negative if they want to, but you will simply not see their comments if you choose not to read them.

Realize that it is not about you. Usually negative comments are not about you. It is about them. When people say or write negative things it is because of their own pain: they release their anger, frustration and sadness through their hurtful comments seemingly directed to you. Understand that you have no idea what is their background, what are they going through and why are they so angry. Forgive them and end them positive vibes.

Realize that negative comments mean popularity. Yes, the more popular your article or blog gets, the more likes, shares and positive messages you will receive. But negative comments also drive readers. Sometimes they drive even more traffic than positive comments or a simple like. Funny enough, negative comments can help you to reach readers who actually need to and want to read your message. 

Turn negatives into positives. It is absolutely possible to turn the negative comments into positive ones. You can address specific comments or the general attitude in a separate post in a positive manner. You can learn from it and find a way to moderate your blog the best possible way for you. You can grow as a person by learning how to deal with negativity. Or like me, you can write an article on sharing how to deal with negative comments.

Breathe, ignore, move on and choose otherwise. If you happen to read a hurtful comment - or perhaps a series of them, like I did - just take a couple of deep breaths. Decide to ignore their negative words. Decide to move on. Choose not to be hurt by them. Smile and choose otherwise. Choose love and happiness instead.

I did choose and continue to choose love and happiness. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

Unsurprisingly, being a minor in a prison built for adults can be a damaging experience.  The recidivism rate for young offenders in New York is almost 70 percent within one year of release.  

Drive Change is a nonprofit that hires young people who have just been released from adult prisons. It then puts them to work in a Queen-based industrial kitchen and on a food truck that appears at muliple sites all over the city, including Dumbo, Roosevelt Island, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

The food truck, Snow Day, is the first in a potential fleet. On its menu: locally-sourced, maple syrup-inspired food.  Jordyn Lexton founded the organization in 2013 with the goal of reducing the number of young people that return to jail after being released with a criminal record. She employs them at $11 and hour and provides what she hopes will be a launchpad into the food industry or other employment opportunities. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

People get married for many different reasons, and for me, Isabel stole my heart the day he promised to fight for justice alongside me for the rest of our lives. Anyone who knows me well will quickly remind you that I'm a ""more than marriage"" kind of guy. My own personal experiences lead me to believe that LGBTQ people need more than state recognition of our relationships to thrive.

Let me be clear, I want to know that Isabel will be able to hold my hand in a hospital when my time to leave this world comes. 

I want to know that our future children will have legal rights which protect them from discrimination. I am honored to have participated in such a historic moment for our movement. I'm so glad we will hopefully turn this page in our struggle, and we are committed to a continued fight for full equality. 

Our fight for full federal equality will only be finished when we can finally have equal access to health, the end of deportations for immigrant LGTBQ individuals, and real answers for situations like the one unfolding in Baltimore, and in other parts across the country. As an immigrant who also identifies as LGBTQ, this moment is bittersweet, and the court system is finally about to make a decision on marriage equality and hopefully acknowledging my personal 14th amendment rights to equal protection. Yet the same court system has stalled President Obama's programs on immigration that will protect millions of people from deportation, including an expansion of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and a similar program that will protect parents of permanent residents and U.S. citizens. 

Everyday I wake up and I quickly look at my phone full of worry for family and friends. Were they apprehended by law enforcement? Did something bad happen? While the courts have stalled progress for undocumented people, the other parts of the executive action related to immigration enforcement were not. As a matter of fact, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is using old tactics such as home raids and family detention, tactics that terrorize immigrant communities. Family detention centers have expanded, meaning that the U.S. is again detaining children and their parents. United We Dream's work in places like Homestead, Fla. shows that DHS is doing raids near schools and churches.

Immigration enforcement impacts thousands of LGBTQ immigrants everyday. Even though the marriage equality cases will finally allow us to progress on this issue, it's time for LGBTQ people and our allies to fight for issues impacting the lives of people of color. Immigration is an important issue for many of us. I can't honestly say that I'll ever find true liberation until I can wake up in the morning without worrying that I'll lose someone to deportation. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

In New York City where both rental and purchase prices are not cheap, the decision can be haunted by uncertainty. 

The New York Times recently published an article explaining that in recent years renters throughout the country are less likely to transition into home buying. According to a study conducted by real estate investment trusts, REITs, only 14.7 percent of tenants who moved out of their rental apartments during the fourth quarter of 2014 purchased a home.  In comparison to the historic average of 17 percent and the mid-2000 housing boom's 20 percent, the current trend shows signs of decreasing home ownership.  

In Manhattan, where a consistently low vacancy rate and high demand control the rental market, rents are unsurprisingly high. In March 2015, the average rent was $4,126 according to appraisal firm Miller Samuel. Despite the increasing rental rate, real estate research analyst David Guarino claims that ""in the most expensive areas, like New York and San Francisco...the percentage of renters moving out tends to be lower,"" equalizing the high rents to high purchase costs. 

However, a decision to purchase does not occur overnight and understanding the cumulative cost of renting over a long period of time and one's own future potential can help make the most economically efficient decision. 

While it is important to look at accrued costs of continual renting, there are still many factors to consider. The New York Times has a ""rent vs. buy"" calculator in which you have the ability to enter your financial information, potential mortgage details, and future rent or purchase fees in order to obtain an itemized break down of the costs to rent or to buy. Factoring in long-term costs or plans, if known, can be beneficial for a renter in order to take advantage of the unfavorable market.  

Despite decreasing homeownership and rental vacancies, an increasing number of both condos and rentals are being developed in the city. Perhaps the increased inventory will be the momentum needed to accelerate the traditional rental, first-time buyer, and veteran buyer cycle. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

Rising up from vast deserts of northern China, Ordos is an oasis of 21st-century glamor, one that made international headlines in 2010 as a futuristic mega-city without a soul in sight.

Located in the vast northern Chinese province of Inner Mongolia, Ordos is home to an estimated one-sixth of the country's coal reserves. Exploiting these massive coal deposits created hundreds of overnight millionaires and giddy local officials who poured money into the main storehouses of economic value in China: infrastructure and real estate. 

Ambitious urban planners mapped out a new district in Ordos -- essentially a city in its own right -- called Kangbashi. Built between 2005 and 2010, Kangbashi was designed as a mix of wide-open urban space and gaudy new structures. Mile upon mile of cutting-edge architecture, including high-rises, stadiums and arts centers, sprung up from the desert sands, ready to house and entertain the expected 1 million future residents.



But that human influx has been slow coming. With few truly indigenous industries or urban centers nearby, the city failed to attract many new migrants. Instead it was media that flocked to Ordos, turning the city's abandoned boulevards and empty office towers into a metaphor for a massive bubble in real estate markets that they warned could pop any day.

The resulting “ghost city” label became a major embarrassment for local officials. In response, the city government doubled down on efforts to draw local farmers to Ordos with generous compensation and free apartments, a process captured in the documentary ""The Land of Many Palaces."" The initiative met with some success, but certainly was not enough to populate the entire city.

City officials have also fought for -- and won -- the right to host events, ranging from the Miss World pageant to China’s National Traditional Games of Ethnic Minorities, in their gorgeous sports stadiums, concert halls and convention centers.


The city's iconic horse statue stands outside of the local government offices. Horses are the adopted symbol of the city, which sits in the midst of the Chinese province of Inner Mongolia.

Today, Ordos’ Kangbashi district sits somewhere between the fantastical visions of its founders and the “ghost city” that haunted media reports. The district’s population reportedly hovers around 100,000 people, representing huge growth compared to previous years but still just a small fraction of what the city was built for. Abutting the city’s futuristic museum and library, a food court verges on bustling at peak hours, and surrounding streets are developing the informal economy of food carts and black cabs found across urban China.



Smatterings of tourists and locals stroll around the city’s waterfront, enjoying a cityscape free from the maladies that haunt other Chinese metropolises: suffocating air pollution, constant traffic gridlock and crushing crowds on public transportation.

As a grand experiment in urban planning, the future of the city remains as uncertain as ever. Ordos rode China’s coal boom for nearly a decade, but the last year has seen the bottom fall out from under coal markets and the steel and cement plants they powered. Natural gas reserves and new factories may provide a backstop, but it’s a far cry from the heady days of coal mania. With the city’s main economic lifeline faltering, a tangled web of public and private debts remains to be unraveled.

Those worries likely preoccupy the coal barons and city officials who poured astronomical sums of money into building the gleaming new Ordos. But for some residents who came away from the boom times with their first apartment and a taste of urban life, Ordos remains just a place to live, and not a bad one at that.

If music is the product of its original environment, Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar has become the quintessential arbiter of this notion. Through his storytelling abilities and lyrical prowess, his latest release, To Pimp a Butterfly, seeks to elucidate the current state of black consciousness and liberation in his most combative effort to date.

The album has instantly become a classic in hip-hop circles, but has also -- on a larger scale -- become a portrait of race dynamics in a post-Ferguson America. Compared to D'Angelo's Black Messiah, which was seen as a necessary therapeutic response to the overarching discussion of police brutality and anti-blackness, Lamar's Butterfly takes a more aggressive stance -- baring visceral angst, discontent and a call for deeper consideration.

Lamar is clear in his position -- both of his own accord, and through factors out of his control --  as a black man who has ""made it"" in America. He discusses being a pawn for white capitalism and his desire to see more opportunity and growth for the entire black community, however, for all of his racial ""consciousness,"" there seems to be little room in his conversation for where black women (and other black bodies) stand.

The first major tell of his brand of black liberation was the album artwork. It's striking, for sure: A group of black men (ostensibly from ""The Hood"") in front of the White House hovering over a fallen white politician -- no doubt Republican. There's even a little girl who appears to be white in Lamar's arms, which seems to play on the long-standing idea of black men being a threat to white women. Perhaps it goes further to suggest that black men already covet the white woman, a la Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. But what's most striking is the lack of black women in the image. It visually suggests that Lamar's view of black liberation stops at black men acquiring power  -- or at least that he thinks once black men are free then everyone else will be.

Lyrically, the album prompts very little discussion of black women, but the sole major inclusion is a misguided use of one in the ""For Free"" interlude. In the jazz-laden track, the woman represents the pressures and expectations that white America places on the black man. It's an ill-favored conflation of the relationship between black men and black women, and the relationship between black men and the ills of white supremacy and capitalism -- suggesting that in America, black men suffer an oppression that black women routinely serve to augment. This choice would have been better executed had Lamar personified his issues with an actual white man to portray what it seems he was truly trying to say. It serves as an ""artistic deployment"" (or pimping) of the image of the black woman to do his bidding, to present his need to resist being used by White America.

Further, this antagonist serves as a caricature of black women and plays on tropes of the ""gold digger"" conflated with the ""Sapphire"" and the ""Strong Independent Black Woman."" She's presented as an exacerbation of Lamar's problems, as if black women do not deal with their own struggles at the hands of White America and capitalism. (Part of that struggle being the attempt to exist outside of these stereotypes.)


The Fall and Expulsion from Garden of Eden (1509-1510), Michelangelo Buonarroti

Stripped of the racial context, this character ultimately hearkens to ""the woman as temptation."" Think the biblical Eve, even Lilith. It speaks to the underlying misogyny that many marginalized men (black, gay, etc.) feel they can skate past because of their minority status. No doubt many black men deal with the expectations of taking care of the women they may be dating and having to work harder than other men -- mainly white men -- to be half as successful and valued, but for an album that is being touted as a great reflection of racial oppression it does so at the expense of black women.

I must admit that my bias against the hyper-masculinity displayed throughout the album threw me off at points -- not unlike the hyper-masculinity that categorically finds a place within hip-hop and the black community on a larger scale. Often the mindset is that because black men have been historically emasculated -- through castration of their bodies, limitation of power and the dismissal of their worth -- that any criticism only eclipses the ""real"" struggle.

There is no denying this emasculation (and adherence to an inherently misogynistic system) is why rappers often refer to themselves as wielding power through the metaphorical use of their genitals. In the ""For Free?"" interlude, Lamar repeats through a rapid-fire explanation of his anger at white, capitalist America and the black woman, ""This dick ain't free."" This serves as subversion --  a penetration and domination of White America, the antagonist. But this unwieldy concept spills over into the consciousness of black men, one that often covets the position of white men without grasping for respect and power on behalf of black women, as well.

To feminize the negative or to negate the feminine serves nothing new or revolutionary to hip-hop or art in general. The woman as muse concept has been used to portray womanhood and femininity as properties that must be organized and made sense of through the lenses and voices of men. Hip-hop, both as an artistic genre and a historic outlet for the black experience, is no different.

On Saturday, 4-year-old Luca Martinez gave the president a proper sendoff with a fist bump before he boarded Marine One. 



Luca’s father, Pablo, is an Associated Press photographer and took his son to the South Lawn to see the helicopter up close, CNN reports. Luca dressed for the big event by wearing a superhero outfit and goggles, and his super powers caught the attention of the president. 

Obama spotted Luca in the press area as he was walking across the lawn and stopped to give him his signature greeting -- with an added exploding fist -- before taking off in the chopper.

Today, the wreckage of the mosque offers a stark reminder of the cultural loss the world has experienced over the last ten years, as iconic spiritual sites have been destroyed as a result of war, short-sighted economic expansion and natural disasters.

Fortunately the human spirit can never be fully extinguished; and many communities have come together to rebuild some of these holy sites and re-envision sacred spaces for the future. 

These ten religious sites are just some of many destroyed or greatly altered since 2005, and they act as a reminder of the important ancient heritage of our world religions -- and a rallying call to preserve others for the future.

001c2715fc750dad8ac69da4d689ad9e,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dana-beyer/marriage-equality-sex-dis_b_7205590.html,"Marriage Equality, Sex Discrimination, and the Future of LGBT Rights","I'm not sure it's necessary to get into sexual orientation to resolve this case,"" he said. ""I mean, if Sue loves Joe and Tom loves Joe, Sue can marry him and Tom can't. And the difference is based upon their different sex. Why isn't that a straightforward question of sexual discrimination?

So asked John Roberts, the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, on Tuesday, April 28th, during oral arguments in the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges marriage equality case.

His question was an afterthought, late in the first round of oral arguments with the Justices questioning the Michigan attorney, John Bursch, he of the baby face and bow-tie who had already argued before this Court eight times, and who was now arguing to limit marriage to ""one man, one woman.""

The country's focus has steadfastly been on Justice Anthony Kennedy, the author of all the pro-gay decisions since Romer v. Evans in 1996, and still the swing vote in most observers' eyes. Kennedy is believed to be willing, once again, to decide on the basis of ""fundamental liberty,"" an argument he made so eloquently in the previous opinions, in spite of his concern last week about overturning ""millennia"" of traditional marriage. The question has now arisen, however, because of the Chief Justice's question in this case and his reticence to engage on fundamental principles in the Windsor and Perry decisions of  2013, as to whether or not he is searching for a way to be on the right side of history but with a different rationale. That would allow him to write a concurring opinion in a 6-3 vote, while ceding pride of place once again to Justice Kennedy, as a capstone to his career as Court champion of gay rights.

All along the focus for those pushing for marriage equality has been on the fundamental right to marry. As we've discovered over the past ten years, the right to marry may be followed during the honeymoon by being fired for being gay. Such an opinion by Justice Roberts, however, would not only strengthen the overall decision, but would put into the Supreme Court's toolbox the importance of viewing sexual orientation as a form of sex, and discrimination against someone on the basis of her sexual orientation as simple sex discrimination. This would help bring ""heightened scrutiny"" into consideration in future gay rights cases; while not binding on the courts it would open the door to the proliferation of such arguments in the future and become even more persuasive.

It would also support the belief I've held for years now that the trans community, should a discrimination case ever make it to the Supreme level, would be protected in a similar manner. Considering the EEOC's Macy decision of 2012 and the parade of positive decisions based on Macy, such as the recent Lusardi case, plus the now full-throated support of not only the EEOC but the Departments of Justice and Labor in support of comprehensive trans rights, that outcome becomes much more likely. Change doesn't occur in society in the manner of ""quantum jumps,"" from zero to one instantaneously. It proceeds at times boldly and other times timidly, beginning with a plausible argument in a dissent, which then appears in a concurrence before years later becoming the majority opinion. The ""tipping point"" is just that; we so quickly forget all the messy efforts over many years in many places that were necessary to build up a consensus to reach that tipping point. And those efforts are not only legal, but legislative and cultural as well.

As an example, I believe that Jenner's public coming-out as trans two weeks ago was just such a tipping point. While we in the community celebrated Laverne Cox appearing on the cover of Time magazine two years ago, we should recognize that few read Time in 2015 and even fewer watch the Netflix series, ""Orange is the New Black,"" in which Cox co-stars. But everyone in the post-war generation knows Bruce Jenner, just as everyone knew Rock Hudson when he died of AIDS in 1986 and Magic Johnson when he announced he was HIV positive in 1991. How else to explain the stunning statement by perennial Republican presidential candidate, Rick Santorum:

If he says he's a woman, then he's a woman,"" Santorum said to reporters Saturday at the South Carolina Republican convention. ""My responsibility as a human being is to love and accept everybody. Not to criticize people for who they are.

That's not what you'd expect from one of the most homophobic Senators in American history. Whether it's the start of a trend or an outlier, only time will tell. But for the Chief Justice, his willingness to broach the question of sexual orientation being reducible to a question of sex is the result of over 40 years of state and federal court cases and societal change. The Kentucky plaintiffs made such a claim in this case, twenty years after the Hawai'i Supreme Court considered same-sex marriage based on the premise of sex discrimination, and the Hawai'i Court noted the earliest cases, as far back as another twenty years earlier, had done the same.

This is so very obvious once you leave the rarefied environs of the high courts of the land. Are there any Americans without law degrees who don't think being transgender or gay is fundamentally a matter of sex? Outside of some antediluvian psychiatrists I haven't found any. Those psychiatrists had to categorize being gay and trans as mental illnesses in order to shut down the argument; it is so obvious to everyone else, including those conservative extremists who fear trans rights functioning as a shield for male sexual predators. When fundamentalist parents speak of the fear of having their children changing in a room with trans women, it's clearly from fear of having to explain sexual variation to their children. They're not thinking of fundamental liberties or the 14th Amendment. Their call for privacy is for protection from having to deal with matters of sex. 

The social rejection of homosexuality and its grounding in sex is made clear in the amicus brief of Clark, Koppelman, et al. The misogyny underlying the rejection is described thusly:

To the extent that laws banning same-sex marriage are motivated by rejection of homosexuality, that purpose is also often closely tied to sex discrimination and the subordination of women. This connection is a matter ""not so much for judicial notice as for the background knowledge of educated men who live in the world."" [Charles L. Black, Jr., The Lawfulness of the Segregation Decisions, 69 Yale L.J. 421, 426 (1960)]. Indeed, homosexuality is itself defined by reference to gender. Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 556 (10th ed. 1994) (defining homosexual as ""of, relating to, or characterized by a tendency to direct sexual desire toward another of the same sex"" and ""of, relating to, or involving sexual intercourse between persons of the same sex"" (emphases added)). The link between prejudice against gays and lesbians and sexism is common knowledge, if anything is. At least until recently, most Americans learned no later than high school that one of the nastier social sanctions that one will suffer if one deviates from the behavior traditionally deemed appropriate to one's sex is the imputation of homosexuality. It is an obvious cultural fact that the stigmatization of homosexuality is closely linked to gays' and lesbians' supposed deviation from the roles traditionally deemed appropriate to persons of their sex. While not all hostility to homosexuality can be attributed to prejudice against perceived gender-nonconformity, such motives are often a major factor. See, e.g., W. Christopher Skidmore, et al., ""Gender Nonconformity and Psychological Distress in Lesbians and Gay Men,"" 35 Archives Sexual Behav. 685, 686-87 (2006) (noting evidence that prejudice against gays and lesbians is often linked to hostility towards gender nonconformity, and finding that lesbians and gay men who exhibit more such nonconformity are subject to greater stigma than those who exhibit it less).

Moreover, the stigmatization of both lesbians and gay men often takes gender-specific forms that imply that men ought to dominate women. While gay men are stigmatized as ""effeminate,"" i.e., insufficiently aggressive and dominant, lesbians are stigmatized as too aggressive and dominant, and are thereby seen as guilty of a kind of gender insubordination. The two stigmas - sex inappropriateness and homosexuality - are often virtually interchangeable. Each is readily used as a metaphor for the other. Much of the resistance to same-sex marriage is likewise parasitic on a gendered conception of marriage in which men and women have distinct and complementary roles, with male dominance a part of the model.

The Chief Justice seems to have read Koppelman and others who have made the same case, going back to Suzanne Pharr in 1988, and it will be a very positive change to the legal environment should he rule in favor of marriage equality based on sex. And if four other Justices would concur it would be a huge advance, the beginning of the end of the fight for full LGBT civil rights. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

b46fa60906c95aac0d6a5328d14cafc1,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/maria-rodale/3-types-of-products-that-_b_7136436.html,3 Types of Products That Pollute Our Water,"by guest blogger Ava Anderson, natural-beauty expert and safe-cosmetics advocate

Earth Day may have come and gone, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be thinking about our planet every day of the year.

Here are three types of products you should put a little thought into before purchasing, as the wrong varieties can have lasting, harmful effects on our waterways, our environment, and ourselves:

1. Scrubs with microbeads. Did you know that Minnesota, New York, Illinois, and New Jersey recently banned the sale of products with microbeads? The rulings came after scientists discovered billions of micobead particles flowing out of water-treatment plants into our waterways and lakes.

How do they get there? After washing your face with a micobead scrub or exfoliator (or brushing your teeth with a micobead-laden toothpaste) the tiny beads are washed down the drain and flow into our waterways.

But the beads that make it into our wastewater-treatment plants aren't filtered out. These plants aren't designed to remove tiny plastic beads from our water; they're only intended to remove and break apart human waste. Therefore, microbeads go back out into the water supply. Sometimes these beads make it out to the ocean, where fish absorb them... Then what? Those fish might the very ones on our plates!

Even more disturbing is the ""toxic sludge"" left behind at the wastewater-treatment plants -- nicely renamed ""biosolids."" This substance is filled with harmful compounds from prescription drugs and household chemicals, and it's often sold to local farmers as ""natural fertilizer."" The harmful chemical content may then leach into our groundwater.

2. Car-washing detergents. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), ""Between 70 and 90 percent of residents reported that their car wash water drained directly to the street and, presumably, to the nearest stream. It has been estimated that 25 percent of the population of the United States may be classified as chronic car washers, which translates into about 27 million potential residential car wash polluters.""

On top of this pollution, a 10-minute car wash can use 100 gallons of water; 20 minutes can equal 200 gallons. With major droughts going on, especially in California, it's time to stop going to conventional car washes or washing our cars at home with too much water and harmful detergents/soaps.

Instead, follow these earth-friendly tips for washing your car:

Use greener soaps/detergent alternatives. Look for waterless, petroleum-free, and biodegradable car wash products.
Wash your vehicle on grass, not pavement. Washing your car on a paved surface (like on the street or your driveway) can cause the soapy water to run into municipal storm drains and pollute local waterways. Instead, the Maryland Department of the Environment suggests that ""washing over an unpaved surface will allow the soapy water to soak into the ground, be filtered, and eventually recharge the groundwater. If you have your own well, you should wash your vehicle at least 100 feet from the well head.""
Use a hose with an automatic shutoff nozzle/power washer. This reduces water waste.

3. Household and personal products containing endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Endocrine-disrupting chemicals like phthalates, parabens, and triclosan are found in everything from soaps to lotions to home-cleaning sprays--and like microbeads, after use, these chemicals often end up in our water supply, where they can then harm wildlife.

EDCs can mess with the hormones of humans, mammals, birds, and aquatic life. And unfortunately, their filtration into our waterways may be causing reproductive and developmental effects for everything from deer to mollusks.

The World Health Organization released a report that stated EDCs may have significant human and wildlife health implications and may threaten our fertility and the environment. So be sure to find personal care products with no EDCs. Check out the Ava's Ingredients to Avoid List to get started.

At the age of 15, Ava Anderson launched her safe line of personal care and home-cleaning products, Ava Anderson Non Toxic. Now 21, Ava is educating hundreds of thousands of American families annually on the issue of toxic chemicals in products through her line, which now includes baby, skin, hair, body, cosmetics, men's, candles, bug, home, sun, and pet products. An undergrad at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, Ava actively helps run her large company with 60-plus employees and thousands of Ava Consultants in every state in the nation. Her goal is to force a paradigm shift on the issue of toxic chemicals in products--with your help.

Add in the family, the partner, the kids, the schedules, the house, the errands, the day-to-day-life, and we're overwhelmed. 

At the center of all this? You. 

It's time to reclaim YOUR power and control over YOUR life. 

What's possible for you when you make this commitment to yourself? A more consistent spark of inspiration and innovation, fun, peace, calm, joy.  

The perfect time to reclaim your power? Mother's Day -- YOUR day. 

Here are my go-to favorite strategies to shift from a place where you're always reacting to a place where you respond and are in greater control of your day. Because the more you feel in control the more time and space you clear for fun, inspiration and joy.

1. Batch or group similar tasks. Batching or grouping similar tasks increases your efficiency without any extra effort on your part. For example, make all of your phone calls at one time, process your email at one time, or review project proposals from vendors at one time. Switching between disparate tasks is highly inefficient because it takes our brains so long to reengage with the task we switched from and to remember what we were actually doing. Work on the same type project or task and increase your output.

2. Work in vacation mode. Have you ever noticed what happens before a vacation? Your inbox is magically cleaned out, projects are wrapped up, and your desk is cleared off. I call this the vacation phenomenon. The vacation is a hard deadline. You are going to be on a sandy beach holding a drink with an umbrella in it on Saturday afternoon. As a result, you have to get the work done before you go. Consider working in vacation mode even if you are not going on a vacation by creating hard stops to your work day. For example, schedule a fun activity after work that has a hard start time -- a movie, a play, or a sporting event. Watch what happens to your productivity during the day.

3. Create a stop doing list. As your responsibilities continue to expand at work, you keep adding tasks and projects to your to do list. But, you never take anything off of the list. Take a hard, critical look at your projects and tasks and ask yourself if each project is still relevant. Think about whether they're directly tied to the organization's strategic goals and/or have a significant return on time investment. There are probably a few tasks and projects lurking on your list that need to be moved to the stop doing list. No one is going to miss them.

4. Decide what is good enough and stop. Do you know what good enough is for each of the projects on your list? This is good enough for the organization and good enough for you. Overthinking, over editing and over tweaking wastes valuable time and is not necessary. Do good work, and then stop.

5. Multitask with caution. Our brains cannot perform two tasks at the same time well. How often have you been on a conference call and maybe it drags on a bit so you decide to check email. You begin processing email and then you hear your name being called. Oh no! You have no idea what was just said. If you must multitask, be very cognizant of the trade-off that you are making.

6. Stop fighting nature. Our brains are hardwired to function in very specific ways. So, no matter how much you try or wish for your brain to function differently it will not. According to David Rock, a neuroscientist, your capacity to make decisions and solve problems is limited by your energy-hungry prefrontal cortex. There is a limit to how much information can be held in the mind and manipulated at any one time. So, don't ask your brain to remember the 15 items you need at the grocery store, your schedule for next week and your ideas for your new project at work. It is not wired to function this way. Use a task list. It is ultimately more efficient and it enables your brain to do what it does best -- think about things not of things.

7. Make your technology work for you, not against you. Today's technology is powerful -- very powerful. However, we often abdicate our own power when we are working with technology. We let it guide and direct us. It pings, dings or rings and we jump. Turn off the technology so you can focus and complete work. Leverage all of the technology tools available to you in your email program by writing rules, color coding incoming emails and auto-filing messages. Take back control and make your technology do all of the heavy lifting.

8. Get back in the driver's seat of your day by making your time work for you, not against you. Leverage the natural efficiencies that can be gained by completing work in groups. Set and adhere to hard stops in your work day. Remove tasks and projects from your to do list that are no longer aligned to your goals, nor your organization's goals. Know what good enough looks like for you and then stop when you reach good enough. Multitask with caution. Stop fighting nature. Make your technology work for you, not against you. Stretch your time today and enjoy your extra minutes!

What are you going to do today to take back control of your day reignite joy in your life? Mother's Day is YOUR day to figure out what will work best for you.

But the reality is that yesterday's prostitution has morphed into a multi-billion international industry increasingly run by street gangs and cyber criminals that treat women and children as chattel. It is nothing short of modern day slavery.

This is a demand-driven industry fueled by adults (mostly men) who buy sex from women and children. Getting adults to stop buying sex from children is a difficult and challenging task and one that is inexorably linked to the adult sex industry itself. As advocates have noted: where there is an adult sex business, the children are on the side, being groomed and recruited. Nobody wakes up at 21 and suddenly decides to become a sex worker--the average age of entry into the trade is actually 12. 

Here in Los Angeles County, our efforts and programs are recognized nationwide. In fact, since last year in Compton, Long Beach and Lynwood, children are no longer arrested for ""prostitution,"" but treated as victims and given the services and the support they require. We plan to expand that program countywide. But we still need to do more.

In April, our delegation from Los Angeles County addressed the issue of sex trafficking with members of Congress. I was struck by the universal acknowledgement from all of our elected officials that commercial sex trafficking is an international problem that deserves our attention. I was particularly impressed by Senator Diane Feinstein's knowledge and commitment to eradicate this scourge in our midst. 

Our time coincided with the Senate's passage of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 (Senate bill 178), which included key provisions from a bill introduced by Senator Feinstein and Senator Rob Portman of Ohio. When it passes Congress and is signed by the President, it will undoubtedly help us in local government to make it more difficult for the buyers. 

Through this bill, the people who fuel this demand-driven industry will be held accountable. Buyers who ""solicit"" and ""patronize"" commercial sex with a child will be committing the crime of sex trafficking. It will increase the investigative tools for state and local law enforcement officers so they can work together to arrest and prosecute those who solicit children for sex. It will increase funding for victim support services while also deterring and punishing child predators. 

But we still have a long way to go. Incredibly, in California soliciting sex from a minor is only a misdemeanor - not the felony I believe it should be. This slap on the wrist is not a deterrent and I believe it must be re-examined by our state legislature. While the Justice for Victims bill will go far towards bringing some true consequences for the so-called Johns, I would also like to see every law enforcement agency in Los Angeles County go after the buyers, fine them heavily and require that they perform long community service hours to understand the suffering they cause. 

We need to re-frame the issue of prostitution. Society at large needs to view these children and young women as victims, not as prostitutes. Indeed, there is no such thing as a child prostitute. They are victims and survivors of statutory rape and should not be arrested and re-victimized.

Our law enforcement efforts should focus on the adults soliciting or selling children. I am pleased to unite with our partners in DC to send the message: Buyers beware, you cannot hide and you will now face the consequences. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

Touring poverty has its obvious ethical questions. We felt a little less self-conscious about it because our hotel had set us up with a company that only employs university students who currently live in Dharavi.

""We all live here by choice. It is not like Slumdog Millionaire. They made it seem much worse,"" said Abhay. ""These aren't unhappy people. I live here. My father is a tailor here. We produce about a billion dollars of the GNP through many businesses; leather refineries, recycling, crafts. We are proud.""





We were asked not to take photos in the residential areas. We walked down narrow dirt alleys, bent over to not get tangled in the low hanging wires. Inside dark rooms, families of five or more lived in 100 square feet,  sharing a public bathroom.

Unfortunately, that is true for the two innocent hostages -- one American, one Italian -- that were killed accidentally in a January 2015 CIA drone strike near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.

Warren Weinstein, a 73-year-old American aid worker, and Giovanni Lo Porto, a 37-year-old Italian citizen both died in a strike that targeted a compound linked to Al-Qaeda. Ahmed Farouq, an Al-Qaeda leader and a U.S. citizen, was also killed in the same strike.

In a brief press conference last Thursday morning, President Barack Obama took ""full responsibility"" and apologized for the death of the two hostages.

""I profoundly regret what happened,"" Obama said. ""On behalf of the United States government, I offer our deepest apologies to the families.""

Weinstein and Lo Porto's death mark the first known instance in which a U.S. drone strike accidentally killed hostages. But it certainly isn't the first time innocent civilians have been killed. Many men, women, and children in the Middle East have seen their loved ones blown to pieces by American drone strikes. 

In October 2012,  a young girl named Nabila Ur Rehman was tending to her cow in the family compound when she witnessed the slaughtering of her grandmother by a drone, right in front of her eyes. The trauma she must have experienced, and the fear that she continues to live with is unfathomable.

Forget waterboarding, a drone strike is torture. 

In Pakistan alone, drone attacks have killed between 400 and 1,000 civilians and over 100 children.

Are drone strikes more efficient than ground troops? Have they killed top Al-Qaeda targets?  Yes and yes.

The American approach to fighting the War on Terror has shifted from a counter-insurgency strategy into a counter-terrorism approach.

Counterinsurgency -- like in Iraq and Afghanistan -- requires protecting the population, winning them over, training the country's army, and gathering human intelligence. The amount of money and military personnel it takes to successfully deploy such a strategy is unsustainable in the long run. Not to mention the inevitability of mass casualties.

As a result, we see more targeted counter-terrorism operations through drone strikes. But that comes with unintended consequences. American intelligence officers from the comfort of their air-conditioned offices can now order the remote-control killing of another human-being in a country the United States may not even be at war with.

America does not capture terrorists anymore. We kill. The White House even has a running ""secret kill list"" and a ""disposition matrix"" to show for it.

The problem with an over-reliance on drones is not whether or not it's effective. It is.

But, at what cost? Are drones as surgical and precise as we think? Have they replaced Guantanamo Bay as the recruiting tool for terrorists? Should they only be used for high-valued terror targets or anyone with a known or unknown association with a terrorist organization? Shouldn't there be more transparency?

Will it ever end?

Perhaps Bruce Riedel, a former CIA analyst and Obama counterterrorism adviser, said it best: ""The problem with the drone is it's like your lawn mower, you've got to mow the lawn all the time. The minute you stop mowing, the grass is going to grow back.""

Maybe there should be a greater focus on stopping the grass from growing. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

It Just Made Their Lives Worse.,"A&E's dramatic reality TV show ""8 Minutes"" claims to rescue sex workers from lives of danger and abuse. But several women who appeared on the show claim that it is a sham, and that the producers left them worse off than before. 

""8 Minutes,"" whose first season aired on A&E between April 2 and April 30, stars Pastor Kevin Brown, a retired police officer. According to A&E's description of the show, Brown poses as a john and arranges to meet sex workers at a hotel. Once the woman arrives, Brown gives himself eight minutes to convince her to get out of the industry and leave the room with his team. 

According to A&E, eight minutes is the maximum amount of time he can talk to a sex worker because ""any longer puts everyone's lives at risk."" 

But several sex workers are claiming that they were set up to appear on the show, rather than being surprised by Brown's visit as A&E claims. They also say that the show's producers failed to get them the assistance they needed, such as help getting jobs, finding housing and, in one case, getting out of jail. 

On April 25, Tits and Sass, a sex worker blog, featured the story of a woman who calls herself 'Kamylla.' The post links to Sex Worker Solidarity, a website that several prominent sex workers who are helping Kamylla created to expose her story and others like it. 

According to Sex Worker Solidarity, a producer from ""8 Minutes"" called Kamylla after seeing her ad online. The producer promised Kamylla that if she appeared on the show, she'd get assistance leaving the sex industry and finding a job and housing. They promised medical and dental care too, Kamylla alleges. 

She claims the producers told her to act as though she had never seen Brown before. When the shoot ended, she says the team gave her $200 and dropped her off at her car, promising they'd call her the next day to get started on finding a job. 

The call never came. Kamylla says she was served with a final eviction notice, and ended up placing another sex work ad. A police officer contacted her pretending to be a john, and she was arrested and jailed. 

According to the site, Kamylla has a husband, children and a college degree, and was never trafficked or forced into sex work. Rather, she became a sex worker out of economic necessity. 

Kamylla and her husband allegedly suffer from chronic health problems, which made it difficult for them to find work. Faced with eviction, Kamylla started secretly working as a prostitute. 

""I did it for my family. Every night I cried in conflict over it. I did what I had to do to take care so that my family wouldn’t be homeless,"" she told the site. 

Kamylla says that the sex workers she met in jail were the first people to truly help her. They helped her contact her husband, who had to sell their kitchen furniture to pay her bail. Sex workers who are advocating for Kamylla are working to get media attention for her story, and have set up a crowdfunding campaign to help her keep her at home. 

After getting out of jail, Kamylla says she called the ""8 Minutes"" producers to ask for help avoiding eviction. She says Brown offered to pray with her, but provided no other support. 

Sex Worker Solidarity also tells the equally disturbing story of a sex worker known as 'Jade,' who also appeared on ""8 Minutes."" According to the site, the producers promised to blur Jade's face on the show, but failed to do so. Now, her landlord, clients and the police know what she does for a living. 

'Donna,' another sex worker who appeared on the show, also believes that she was misled by the producers. She told BuzzFeed that the producers told her husband to pose as her pimp and that she thought she would be given assistance after appearing on the show. But the only help she got from the program was the phone number of a counselor. 

""I don’t need a therapist: I need a place to live,” she said. 

A&E did not respond to requests for comment. Relativity Television, the production company behind ""8 Minutes,"" declined to comment. Sex Worker Solidarity did not respond to a request for comment.

WASHINGTON, May 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Tuesday narrowly passed a Republican budget plan that prescribes deep domestic spending cuts to eliminate deficits by 2024 and aids the party's goal of trying to dismantle President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law.

The first combined House-Senate budget in six years passed 51-48 with all Senate Democrats and two Republicans voting against it, presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Rand Paul.

Senator David Vitter, a Republican who is running for Louisiana governor this year, did not cast a vote.

The non-binding resolution does not go to Obama's desk to be signed into law. Instead, it helps guide Congress' consideration of government agency spending bills and serves as a Republican fiscal policy manifesto that will influence 2016 election campaigns.

The blueprint would slash spending on the social safety net, education, infrastructure and other domestic programs by $5.3 trillion over 10 years with no tax increases. At the same time, it boosts defense spending next year by adding about $38 billion to an off-budget war operations account.

Senate Republicans hailed it as the first balanced budget plan since a 2001 surplus, hoping to score points among voters worried about mounting U.S. debt levels.

""American families know they can't live on borrowed money, and neither can the federal government,"" said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi. ""This balanced budget shows these families that if they can do it, so can we.""

But most of the prescribed cuts will be ignored, as the new budget plan does not instruct congressional committees to implement them. Instead, the ""reconciliation"" instructions are focused on easing the way to repealing the Affordable Care Act.

These provisions will allow Republicans to use procedural tools to pass such legislation with only a simple majority in the Senate, rather than a near-impossible 60-vote threshold that would otherwise be needed.

While Obama is certain to veto any Republican bill to repeal his biggest domestic policy achievement, he may be more willing to compromise on changes to ""Obamacare"" if the U.S. Supreme Court in June strikes down the law's health insurance subsidy mechanism in many states.

In debate on Tuesday, Democrats played up the hardships that would result from the budget's deep cuts to food stamps and healthcare for the poor, as well as college tuition grants.

""That's what they want to run on? Be my guest,"" said Democratic Senator Richard Durbin, referring to the 24 Republican senators seeking re-election in 2016 (Reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Eric Beech and Lisa Lambert) -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

The New Testament has law. When you read it, you can see that the first Christians were dealing with a lot of rules and regulations. Don't gossip, don't commit murder, don't tell lies, don't think immoral thoughts. Sometimes it feels like the New Testament focuses as much on the dos and don'ts as the Old Testament does, right?

People say, ""Christians live by too many rules."" They're wrong. We don't live by too many rules. We don't live by any rules! We live according to commandments, and there are two of those, which are actually just one: Love God our Father with all our heart, mind, soul, and strength, and love our neighbor as ourselves. 

It doesn't mean that we sin whenever we want. It means we don't want to sin. It happens, of course. Have I lied? Yes! Did it feel good? No! Do I want to do it again? No!

I don't steal. I don't cheat on my wife. I don't commit murder. Sometimes I have unhealthy thoughts. I don't like it, but I do, and I will as long as there's flesh on my bone. Where there is flesh, there is sin. 

In Romans 7, Paul says, ""There's a battle waging inside me. Who can save me from this sin?"" Jesus saves you. He's the one inside of you that reminds you who you are. It is through Him that you are made holy and righteous. You will live out of your flesh at times, but that's not your identity. Your identity is Kingdom identity. 

This does not mean that I'm a sinner that's saved. It means I am a saint that sins. That's two different views, right? One theology teaches that you're a sinner. It's a theology that says, ""I want to control that individual, so I'm going to tell him, 'You need me, because you're going to sin and you need saving.'"" But that's not what Jesus says. Jesus says you're a saint that sins. He tells you, ""You don't need them. They need me! I make saints that mess up from time to time."" 

Holy and righteous people aren't idol-worshippers or backstabbers or God-haters. We don't gossip, murder, tell lies, steal, or have immoral thoughts. It doesn't square with who we are. We are confident in our understanding of who we are in Christ. We can say, ""Those aren't dos and don'ts. Those aren't even commands from God. It's not necessary to require moral behavior from me. I live morally because of who I am, not because I'm afraid God is going to be disappointed in me."" 

Doing good is as natural to Kingdom people as an Inuit wearing furs to stay warm, or a Muslim woman wearing a scarf to cover her hair. Do we make mistakes? Yes. Do we battle with the desires of the flesh? Yes. But this isn't what defines us.

And it's certainly not motivated by fear. Kingdom people don't do the right thing because they want God to like them, or because they fear His disappointment or His punishment. Kingdom people do the right thing simply because it's obvious to us that goodness is good. It's how we live, because it's who we are.

                                                                       # # #

On June 26, 2013, Officer Philippe Archer was recorded on a security camera punching model Megan Adamescu in the head after she kicked him in the leg while she was handcuffed. (Watch the video above.) 

According to the Miami Herald, Adamescu was drunk that night in the lobby of the South Bay Club in South Beach and would not leave.

The Herald reports:

Archer escorted Adamescu outside, where he noted in the arrest report that she was too drunk to give him her identification. Archer took her purse to get her ID himself, which agitated Adamescu.

Archer, who is black, reported that Adamescu started using racial slurs at the detective.

A passerby, Andrew Mossberg, saw this and thought he was witnessing a mugging. He decided to intervene. According to the police investigation, Mossberg called the police and stepped in even after Archer identified himself. Adamescu then hit a distracted Archer, who struck her and Mossberg in the ensuing struggle.

The Miami New Times published a photo in August 2013 of Mossberg with a swollen face after the altercation.

According to CBS Miami, Archer has been a defendant in several other lawsuits involving excessive force, including Guy Moulin, who settled with the city for $60,000 in 2013 after he alleged he was beaten by Archer. 

Miami Beach police on Monday released the video of Archer's altercation with Adamescu, along with 500 pages of investigation material. 

“This officer should have been fired,” Mossberg's attorney, Ray Taseff, told CBS. ""Mr. Mossberg does the right thing and makes the right call, and he is then retaliated against by Officer Archer.""

A state attorney and the FBI chose not to prosecute Archer after the incident. According to a memo provided to the Miami New Times, prosecutors did not think the video was clear enough to ""prove a criminal intent on the part of the subject.""

Adamescu and Mossberg plan to sue the city, CBS Miami reports. Archer will be allowed to serve his four-week suspension two days at a time, over the course of several months. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

Festivals have been integral to the narrative of drag culture from the days of Lady Bunny's Wigstock to Brooklyn's Bushwig, founded by Horrorchata and Babes Trust. Not only do they provide a platform to expose audiences to the spectrum of drag performance, but festivals offer opportunities and spaces for new practices in queer community culture unlike any other.



Curated by Jamie Steward Bancroft, the Austin International Drag Festival lived up to its predecessors. The three-day event brought together an interesting mix of legends like Jackie Beat and Lady Bunny, ""RuPaul's Drag Race"" girls like Adore Delano and Pandora Boxx, and queens that are staples in their local queer communities.

""The festival exceeded all my expectations and it was wonderful to see my dream come to life,"" Bancroft told The Huffington Post. ""Our mission was successful. I heard many drag artists say they were able to make valuable connections and book more gigs outside of their hometowns. Just knowing that I helped them with their drag careers warms my heart. I am so thankful to everyone involved for helping make what started out as a twinkle in my eye a year ago a reality.""



New York was well represented at the festival, with Brooklyn artists Merrie Cherry, Horrorchata, Goldie Peacock, Chris of Hur, Charlene, Crimson Kitty, Louvel, Untitled Queen and Heidi Glum giving shows all weekend. 

We also met some new queens that we're definitely going to keep our eyes on, including Austin's PooPoo Platter drag collective, Louisianna Purchase and Cupcake, as well as Portland, Oregon's Pepper Pepper and Carla Rossi.

They gave even more to their future selves, investing some $300 billion in their retirement accounts. Clearly, $241 billion in donations has the potential to accomplish a lot of good. But what about the investments?

The conventional view of investing is that it has one purpose: to make money. The interest paid by most savings accounts doesn't keep ahead of inflation, so savings lose value over time. In contrast, investments can grow over the long term at rates that comfortably exceed inflation. For people without employer pensions, the growth provided by their own investments may be the only way to ensure they will have enough money to meet their needs when they stop working.

Of the $241 billion donated by Americans to charities, most of it went to religion, education, human services, and grantmaking foundations. Where did the $300 billion in investments go? Mostly into the pockets of other investors. When you buy shares of stocks or mutual funds on the stock market, you usually purchase them from another investor who's selling them. The investor uses the money from the sale to buy other investments, or cashes it in for personal or business use.

A growing number of investors and philanthropists see that as a lost opportunity. What if you could put your investments to work in doing good, while still earning a decent financial return? That question is at the heart of a branch of socially responsible investing known as impact investing. 

What is Impact Investing?
Impact investing bypasses the stock market to invest directly in companies, organizations, and projects that generate social and/or environmental returns in addition to financial ones. It's not a tradeoff: impact investors don't accept below-market returns in exchange for the satisfaction that their investments are contributing to a better world. Instead, they look for blended value: they seek competitive returns along with social and environmental benefits.

One of the most compelling examples of impact investing involves the company that brought mobile phone service to sub-Saharan Africa. Antony Bugg-Levine and Jed Emerson describe this story in their book, Impact Investing: Transforming How We Make Money While Making a Difference. Celtel Africa, founded in 1998 by a Sudanese engineer named Mohammed Ibrahim, initially had a hard time attracting capital. Conventional investors saw Ibrahim's venture as too risky and with limited potential for return. Eventually Ibrahim found a firm committed to investing in Africa and other emerging markets. With that seed money, Celtel Africa went on to find more than 6 million customers, and was sold in 2005 to another company for $3.4 billion, providing triple-digit returns to its investors. Cell phones have revolutionized life for many Africans, including creating a new mechanism for transferring funds. Charities such as GiveDirectly, which rely on mobile phones to deliver payments, wouldn't exist if it weren't for the commitment of those original impact investors.

How You Can Participate
When I first learned about impact investing a few years ago, I got excited. I saw it as a logical way to complement my charitable giving. I was already investing for retirement, so it made sense to start putting those investments to work in ways that benefit others, not just my own bottom line. But I quickly learned that unless you're a venture capitalist or an accredited investor, opportunities for impact investing are limited. Most impact investments available to small individual investors in North America, Europe, the UK, and Australia involve debt rather than equity: your money is used to provide loans to organizations and projects, rather than investing directly in companies. That means the potential for financial return is low, similar to what you might get from bonds or guaranteed savings deposits. Furthermore, many of the opportunities available to small investors aren't eligible for tax-sheltered retirement accounts.

But impact investing is a relatively new area, and things are changing rapidly. Efforts are underway to make a broader range of investment opportunities available to small investors. If you're intrigued by the concept, take time to learn more and consider whether impact investments would make sense as a portion of your portfolio. They may not be as effective as the best charities, but they're likely to provide more social and environmental benefits than those of traditional investments. Visit the sites I've linked to below to monitor new developments.

The full extent of the damage done by the violence in Baltimore will not be known for months. But we do know this -- probably 100 shops, businesses and gas stations were burned and ransacked. Parts of this grand city were turned into a War Zone. Shopkeepers fled in fear of their lives as looters, seeking a Five-finger discount, stole everything. A family of four, living in an apartment above the liquor store they owned, fled to save their lives when their store was set ablaze beneath their feet by the rioters.

But suddenly, a week after the riots started, calm has returned to that City. The city lifted its curfew, the National Guard is exiting and a mall that was the center-point of the riots has reopened.

One huge lesson that Executives can learn from the situation in Baltimore is this: Distrust leads to chaos. Unless, you have trust, nothing is going to happen positively in your organization. When trust is absent, everything deteriorates.

I have been sickened by the chaos that has ensued in so many places in the United States -- locations like Ferguson County, Philadelphia, New York and Florida. Yes -- the trigger that lit these flames of chaos was alleged police misconduct targeting minorities but the reason these matters get out of hand and continue for months on end is the direct result of a lack of trust.

Until now... Marilyn J. Mosby took decisive action. She is the Baltimore State Attorney who announced on Friday that 6 police officers have been charged in the death of Freddie Gray, a young man who died a couple of weeks ago after suffering a severe spinal injury while in police custody.

I have never met Ms. Mosby and I am quite sure that she and I differ politically but she did something very positive that all Executives can learn from. She established trust.

She reestablished Trust with the people of Baltimore and as a result, the chaos has been quelled.

Let me be upfront -- I don't know whether those 3 black and 3 white police officers in Baltimore are guilty as charged. I am naturally sympathetic with them as they undoubtedly have put their lives on the line everyday to protect their fellow citizens of Baltimore.

But someone had to stand up and move forward aggressively. Ms. Mosby has done that. It should be noted that Marilyn is the daughter and granddaughter of police officers. I am confident that she has not taken this matter of filing charges against the law enforcement personnel lightly.

Critics will accuse Ms. Mosby of playing politics and say she moved forward too quickly with insufficient proof. But given her strong family history in law enforcement combined with the fact that prosecutors do not like to bring cases they cannot win, I suspect this prosecutor has a strong case.

But regardless of how this prosecution plays out, my point today is simply this. Trust is essential to any organization whether it is the City of Baltimore or IBM. Here are five ways leaders can engender trust:

1. Deliver on your Promises

Be a person of integrity -- Be the one who is known for delivering on commitments.

2. Be Transparent in your Communications 

When the opportunity to be vague arises, don't do it!

3. Be Decisive

People hate fence-sitters. I would rather make a good decision today than a great decision 30 days from now.

4. Speak from your Heart

The easiest thing to do is to just state facts. But you need to show your compassion. Be willing to trust others by expressing your personal emotions. You will find your followers will reciprocate that trust.

5. Follow up with a sense of Urgency -- get the news out quickly -- whether it be bad or good. When information is known, share it.

Remember this as a leader: trust does not come automatically. It is the direct result of honest, open and frequent communications.

Back in January, Mosby acknowledged the long-standing problems between residents and the police. She spoke passionately about her hope to help bridge that ""trust gap."" She even stated: ""There are barriers of distrust within the community and law enforcement.""  She knew there was a problem, attacked it decisively, communicated openly and from her heart and good things happened.

I recently wrote in my book Up Your Game, that the reality of today's leadership demands individuals who will develop deep and trusting relationships. When trust exists in an organization, everything accelerates. When trust doesn't exist, things slow down because people will always be trying, from the CEO down, to cover their own tracks. When trust is lacking, people are afraid to take bold action.

So whether you run the City of Baltimore or International Business Machines, trust is essential to your success. In fact, Thomas J. Watson, IBM's Founder, once said:  ""The toughest thing about the power of trust is that it's very difficult to build and very easy to destroy.""

Trust, for now, has been restored to the City of Baltimore. May each Executive recognize that powerful need for trust and the amazing power for good it can have on accelerating the accomplishments of your organization.

College Decision Day, has passed, most parents can stop stressing about their child getting into school. Unfortunately, they might have a new worry to keep them up at night. Will their son or daughter spend their college years learning essential workplace and career skills, or will their chosen school offer them courses like ""Zombies and Gender in Pop Culture?""

That's the latest, and one of the most popular courses currently offered at Wright State University in Fairborn, OH. According to the professor, who holds dual appointments in both the English and Women's Studies departments, the course demands ""serious academic work"" from its students. ""We are particularly concerned that when the zombie apocalypse happens and there is no social order, what happens after that?"" she says.

Similar college-level courses on pop culture can be found all over the country, at many well-known and respected institutions of higher learning. Some current and recent past examples:

- Zombies (George Mason University). ""Fulfills the college requirement in non-Western culture.""
- What If Harry Potter Is Real? (Appalachian State University). ""Students will examine issues of race, class, gender... as well as how to read a novel and how to read scholarly essays."" Let's keep in mind, Harry Potter is a young adult series.
- Learning from You Tube (Pitzer College). Even the professor calls it ""a really weird class.""
- Lady Gaga and the Sociology of Fame (University of South Carolina). ""This is not a course in music or cultural studies.""
- Philosophy and Star Trek (Georgetown University). ""In conjunction with watching Star Trek, we will read excerpts from the writings of great philosophers.""

Currently, the average cost for a single college credit hour ranges from about $200 (in-state) to over $1,100 at a private university. Most college courses are about 3 credits, which means one zombie course can cost over $3,300. Naturally, this begs the question: Would you spend thousands of dollars for your 18-year-old to study zombies and Harry Potter?

To be fair, in some of these classes, the students are not just sitting around eating popcorn and watching movies. Many of the professors demand a fair amount of written work -- essays, papers, theses, etc. -- and testing, in return for their students' understanding of literary, social or psychological dynamics  via pop culture. In my own 1980s college days, I happily fulfilled a general curriculum requirement with an Intro to Film course, where I got to sit back for two hours watching Citizen Kane and the film noir classic The Third Man, both of which probably helped shape my views of both newspaper publishing and Allied-Soviet relations in post-war Europe better than any textbook could.

But...and there are a few notable ""buts"":

1.  I entered a job market where I and my peers expected, received and were content with entry-level jobs at entry-level wages. Even with unemployment at a fairly high seven percent, I honestly didn't know of a single grad who didn't have some kind of job within 6 months of graduating. Why? Because you took whatever you could to get started and get out of your childhood bedroom, and you could afford to take something low-paying because you weren't saddled with student loan debt.

2.  I didn't have to know Word or Excel or Powerpoint or the myriad of other software programs that grads now need to be familiar with -- they didn't exist. The only computer course I ever took involved basic language and punch cards, while today's job-seekers practically need to know coding just to get their feet in the door. 

3.  An entire year's tuition at my in-state university cost me $2,500. Today's average in-state tuition is about $9,000 and growing rapidly. One Intro to Film course wasn't going to break the bank, nor were there that many ""fluff"" courses offered to begin with.

Flash forward to today's job market. College students simply don't have the luxury of taking too many ""easy A"" classes, because potential employers demand so much more of them. Many recent grads won't even consider taking an entry-level job, which in some cases might just be a glorified gopher, because they can't afford to without defaulting on their student loan payments or going into significant credit card debt just to meet basic living expenses. And even if they will take it, they'll still need basic skills like the ones mentioned above, which are deemed by employers as far more necessary than an understanding of the socio-economic impact of zombies after the apocalypse. 

Of course, a college education isn't supposed to be just about learning workplace-specific skills or technology. It has been and is supposed to be about developing higher thinking skills, as well. As a former liberal arts major, I can certainly attest to the need, if not the requirement, for colleges to teach advanced critical thinking and analysis, which does indeed become applicable in the ""real"" world.

But colleges that offer these courses just in the hopes of attracting students to more advanced academic ideas and principles are doing their students, not to mention the parents who might be footing the bill, a huge disservice. Contrary to popular belief, American students today are not lazier thinkers than students in previous decades, nor are they any more shallow or superficial than any past 18 or 19 year olds. But colleges seem to think they are, and insult their intelligence by assuming that they need to be led like little children to higher learning with shiny trinkets and sparkly baubles. 

Students want to learn; they don't have to be tricked into it. And when professors feel that they have to dangle pop culture in front of their students just to engage them in the very topics they're paying a high price to study, something has truly gone askew in our education system. Perhaps the zombie apocalypse isn't so far off, after all... -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

WASHINGTON, May 5 (Reuters) - Bernie Sanders, a self-described socialist U.S. senator who has launched a bid for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, said on Tuesday he will introduce a bill to break up the biggest banks, a position far to the left of the party's front runner, Hillary Clinton.

Calls for Wall Street's largest firms to be cut down were numerous after taxpayers spent billions of dollars to prevent the financial system from collapse during the 2007-09 financial crisis, but they have since gradually died down.

Sanders faces long odds against Clinton's fund-raising might, and his views might help position the former secretary of state and first lady more as a moderate and buttress her efforts to attract money from banks' deep pockets.

Under the Sanders proposal, regulators on the existing Financial Stability Oversight Council would compile a list of institutions that are 'too big to fail' and implicitly rely on government support during a crisis.

""If an institution is too big to fail, it is too big to exist,"" Sanders said in a statement.

Within a year of enactment of the bill, the Treasury secretary would be required to break up these firms. They would also be prohibited from using any customer funds for risky or speculative activities on financial markets.

Sanders, an independent from Vermont, launched his long-shot bid last week, highlighting his fight against authorizing the Iraq war, which Clinton voted to authorize as a senator, and putting pressure on her political agenda from the left.

Sanders is not alone in his view that large banks still pose an undue risk to the economy after causing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.

Senator Elizabeth Warren, a highly visible Democrat from Massachusetts, also wants to break up big banks. Among regulators, Tom Hoenig, second-in-command at the powerful Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, wants the same thing.

Still, the bill stands a near-zero chance of becoming law. Representative Brad Sherman, a Democrat from California, also backed the bill, but it has no Republican support. Republicans hold the majority in both houses of Congress.

President Barack Obama is also opposed to making any changes to the 2010 Dodd-Frank law aimed at reforming Wall Street.

He's no slouch when it comes to growing a beard, either.

Instead of uploading the standard selfie or a confusing group photo with a bunch of dudes (which. one. are. you?), the 30-year-old comedian went rogue and uploaded pics that showed off his true self. The photos  shot to the top of Reddit when someone posted them there Monday night (Nope, Mirvis didn't post the pics himself -- he's no showboat -- but he was thrilled when he saw the thread.) 

In one photo, he goes full viking, flanked by a donkey: 



In another, he tosses a football while his bad boy beard blows in the wind: 



He puts in some one-on-one time with a furry friend here: 



And gulps down his beer of choice in another: 



In an interview with The Huffington Post, Mirvis said those who swipe right tend to do so out of admiration for the beard, which he's been growing out for as long as he's been able to. As for how how he ended up with such memorable photos, he's just naturally #blessed with being photogenic. 

""I don't know if it's because I look so cartoonish or if it's because I tend to live a cartoonish lifestyle, but I've always been lucky enough to get fun photos,"" he said. ""My attitude toward [creating] a profile is simple, 'Would I like this guy?'""

The people of Reddit clearly like Mirvis. Since screen caps went up, he's gotten a lot of love on-thread and even more in his direct messages.

""This whole thing has been insane and my inbox is jam-packed with the kindest, and sometimes dirtiest, messages,"" he told us. ""Maybe my wife is out there!"" 

So what's he looking for in the future Mrs. Mirvis? 

""All I really want in a partner is just that -- a partner,"" she said. ""Someone who challenges and supports me, someone who excites and scares me, someone who I can cause mischief with just as easy as someone who I could binge watch 'Game of Thrones' with. Couldn't hurt if they were an NFL fan, too!""  

Ladies: prepare to swipe right.

As I started my first day as a labor and employment attorney, I was thrilled with the intensity of having to negotiate on behalf of large companies and felt challenged with having to understand the innumerable legal issues we were working through at any given moment. 

Law wasn't my first love, but I didn't know that yet. I would later learn that law was probably like that expensive shoe you keep in your closet, the one that is probably a little too high in the heels and hurts your foot every single time you wear it but too expensive to throw out.  

I loved the idea of law, but little did I know, that I would have another chance at a dream career.  

When I was working as a lawyer I would leave ""going to the library"" notes on my desk so I could sneak out for some much-needed retail therapy.  This therapy seemingly worked. As I was climbing the ranks at the firm, I was also gaining the admiration of my colleagues for being the ""best-dressed"", who could always be counted on for some fashion advice and tips. 

I always loved fashion but never really thought about a career in it. When I first started Linda's Stuff I was selling my kids' old video games on this new site called eBay. When they sold out, I immediately switched gears to selling my own designer clothes and it ignited a flame in me. It was a like a light went off and I thought, this is fun and I am good at it. My friends were also intrigued that I was making such good money selling my clothes online. They asked me to do it for them and gave me a percentage of their profit. These friends became my first consigners! 

Building a business takes dedication and lots of time management. And for me in the early years of Linda's Stuff, lots of learning on the job as I went. I ran the business entirely from my home for the first five years (2001-2006) and did every job from taking the pictures, to writing the listings to packing and shipping. So now as we've grown to over 110 employees working in a 93,000 sq. ft. warehouse, I can honestly say I've done every single job in our organization at some point.

Here are some basic rules every entrepreneur should know:

1. Have a Mentor

My father is my mentor. He is a lifelong entrepreneur who started a security business for clothing, which was visionary back when he launched it. The business was a success and supported our family of five until he sold it. Watching my dad turn his idea into a successful business that allowed him to support his family and do what he loved, was my inspiration. 

My advice is to find a mentor who is not afraid to point out the mistakes you are making and one who can offer you guidance on important business decisions. 

2. It's All in the Details

In my business, I am trained in the art of spotting fakes.  In luxury goods, I work with reputable authenticators so that my customers know and trust that the luxury items I am selling are authentic. I've built a client base that's bar none because our first job is to build trust and relationships.  

3. Pick Up What Other People Put Down

Never underestimate the value of your things. While it is great to donate to charity and Goodwill, your things have much more value than you may perceive. ""One man's trash is another man's treasure"" may be an old adage but it is true. And honestly it has never been truer than it is today. 

With people being so financially responsible and concerned with the economy, the market for gently used goods is burgeoning.  Never underestimate the power of reinvention. Take if from me, I reinvented my career and created a business I could have never imagined owning.

42a2a4a65b57278c9d5dff56fd85b204,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-tobia/the-power-of-trans-vulnerability_b_7213994.html,The Power of Trans Vulnerability,"To be honest, I was nervous. It was an hour before one of the most famous transgender people in the world was set to come out on national television, and like many trans activists, I had a knot in my stomach. A litany of questions swirled in my head: What was Bruce Jenner going to say? How were they going to present their transition? How were they going to talk about the trans community? Would they make note of the fact that their story was only one of many? Would they acknowledge the privilege that they have as a white, wealthy trans woman? Would they help move the trans community forward on matters of national and local policy?

I gnawed my lip nervously as I sat down to watch the interview. Twitter at the ready, I prepared for the worst.

But within the first three minutes of the special, my anxiety subsided into quiet admiration. I wasn't quite sure what I'd expected, but it certainly wasn't this.

I expected Bruce to be composed, poised, prepped and polished. I expected them to have on a glamorous outfit befitting a Jenner. I expected them to present themself to the world for the first time as a gorgeous, cisgender-passing woman. I expected them to have their guard up and to have rigorously rehearsed answers to each and every question.

I saw none of that. What Bruce presented to the world was not a transitioned woman, but a woman in transition. They presented themself in a simple blue shirt, little makeup, black slip-on shoes and a pair of imminently parental white socks. They were not glammed up or made-up -- they even began their interview with a ponytail.

The Bruce Jenner we saw was not glamorous. The Bruce Jenner we saw was vulnerable. And that makes all of the difference.

We can't underestimate the power of trans people sharing their vulnerability, because it is so rare and so precious. As a genderqueer person, I feel constant pressure not to be vulnerable. In order for my femininity to be respected and valued by others, I feel pressure to be polished, to wear the highest heels, to put on the brightest lipstick and to sport the most gorgeous outfits. I feel like I have to be conventionally beautiful (in the cissexist, misogynist, racist, imperialist sense of the term) so that other people can learn to respect the transgender and genderqueer community. If I don't present myself as conventionally beautiful, people consistently dismiss my femininity and my genderqueer identity. 

More than that, I feel that I have to be composed. As the token trans person in many people's lives, I have to know the answer when someone asks a question about the trans community. Because I'm so visible, I have to be a spokesperson. I have to put my guard up, say the right things and present 100 percent certainty in my gender identity.

But the reality is that gender identity doesn't work that way. No one is ever 100 percent certain in their gender identity, because gender identity is a journey, not a destination. Everyone -- whether you're transgender or cisgender -- is learning more about their gender identity throughout their lifetime.  

What was so powerful and surprising about Bruce's interview was that they admitted they didn't have all of the answers yet. From using the pronoun ""he"" for the whole interview, to discussing their uncertain feelings about their sexual orientation, Bruce presented the world with a work in progress, not a final product. They showed us all that it is okay to be trans without having all of the answers. They showed us that it is okay to come out as trans even while you're figuring things out. They showed us that you don't have to know how to explain everything in order to be embraced, and that you don't have to fully pass as a woman in order to exist and be respected as a woman.

We can't underestimate the cultural significance of Bruce's vulnerability. By showing their vulnerability to the world, and by asking the world to embrace them nonetheless, Bruce provided a powerful model for trans acceptance. As trans people, we don't only need support and acceptance once we have transitioned. In fact, support and acceptance are even more vital when we are transitioning, because it is during those early days of our gender exploration that we are most vulnerable.

One of the tenderest moments in my life was the moment when I first walked around in high heels publicly. As I left my dorm room and stepped into the world, I was mortified. I was scared because I had never worn heels in public before, but more than that, I was scared because I didn't fully understand what it meant that I wanted to wear high heels in the first place. I hadn't yet put together the pieces of my genderqueer identity -- clarity about my identity would only come years later.

In those vulnerable early moments when I first began expressing my genderqueer identity, the support I received from my friends was life changing. The support I received when I was still uncertain about my identity gave me the space I needed to claim my identity and love myself in new ways.

That is why Bruce Jenner's vulnerability is so important; because it helps millions of people learn to support trans people when we need it most. Moreover, Bruce set a profound example for young trans people across the country. Through embracing vulnerability and showing it publicly, Bruce helped a generation of young trans kids learn that you don't have to have all the answers before you come out. You can be yourself and be supported by your family not only when you know who you are, but as you're learning how to explain who you are.

So to Bruce Jenner -- and the thousands of transgender or gender non-binary people across the world who are courageous enough to live authentically -- thank you for your vulnerability. The world is a kinder and more empathetic place because of it. 

Note: There has been a lot of public debate about what pronouns journalists should use when referring to Bruce Jenner. Because Bruce has not clarified their pronouns publicly, I have chosen to use the gender-neutral pronouns they/them/their for the purposes of this article. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

Many of these families had traveled days and nights to receive treatment from doctors who volunteered with nonprofit World Pediatric Project (WPP), an organization that provides medical care to critically ill children in developing countries. 

The majority of the mothers Alden saw in the hospital were single parents. She asked herself, ""Can these women both financially support their families and be caregivers to their sick children?"" It seemed like an impossible task, and the answer for many was no. After contacting WPP's local coordinator and asking if any of these single mothers had sewing skills, she was introduced to Ana Vasquez. 

Ana was an unemployed single mother who had a teenage daughter, Celine. Celine had been diagnosed with spina bifida--a rare condition requiring highly specialized medical treatment and numerous lengthy trips to hospitals for surgeries. Ana had been let go from her two previous jobs because of the incredible amount of time needed to care for her daughter.  She needed a job with flexible hours that would allow her to support her family both as a caregiver and as a breadwinner. Alden wanted to help.






One year later in Ana's hut in Orange Walk, Belize, Ana and Alden worked on a rented sewing machine to design the first Alden Skirt prototype. From that first skirt in 2013 grew the social enterprise Alden Skirts. Each skirt is created by a single mother like Ana who is caring for a child like Celine. In addition, a portion of Alden Skirts' profits go to WPP to support their continuing treatment of critically ill children. 

Above, Ana speaks about her life, Alden Skirts, and her daughter's health. Here is a brief preview of Ana's interview:

""I am so proud and happy. It has changed for the good and a lot. I have 3 beautiful daughters- 2 in high school. Thanks to Alden Skirts, I can send my daughter to school. I'm paying 2 school fees with Alden Skirts. I am so happy. I had been so stressed before on how to pay my fees. So I feel stressless now. Thanks to the good Lord to give me this opportunity that I found these good people.""

District officials confirmed to CBS7 last Friday that the Crane Independent School District has seen 20 cases of the sexually transmitted disease in its high school, adding that letters have also been sent to the district's junior high school as a precaution.

The station estimates 1 in 15 students at the school has contracted chlamydia.

The high school offers a three-day sexual education course once a year that emphasizes abstinence.

Per the school's 2014-2015 handbook, Crane ISD ""does not offer a curriculum in human sexuality,"" but the handbook does lay out state-mandated stipulations should a curriculum be needed in the future:


In a conversation with the San Antonio Express-News on Monday, school superintendent Jim Rumage defended the abstinence-heavy course. 

""That's not a bad thing,"" said Rumage, ""because if kids are not having any sexual activity, they can't get this disease. That's not a bad program.""

Diana Martinez, a Crane resident and parent, told NewsWest 9 her kids are too young for her to worry about; otherwise,  she'd sit them down and have a talk.

""Honestly this happens in any town,"" Martinez said. ""Parents need to be aware of the situation and make sure they tell their kids to be safe and practice safe sex.""

The school's health advisory committee met Monday to discuss the outbreak and formulate a response, which it will present to the school board on May 19. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.
